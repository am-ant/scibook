# Welcome!

Here, at **SciBook**, we analyze various interesting and important topics, based on reliable sources, trying to adhere to scientific information. We put references to all our sources so that everyone can check and make up their own opinion or correct us. Do not believe us, check it out for yourself!
Let's start with one of the probably most important topics: health in the context of the mandatory vaccinations.

<span class="underline">Vaccines</span>: what they are for, what is their effect, how they are designed and produced, what side effects do they have? Almost any drug or medication has side effects. And vaccines are hardly an exception.

It does not matter how much time you have to study the material. What important is your motivation: the health of your children and/or curiosity.

Thusâ€¦
