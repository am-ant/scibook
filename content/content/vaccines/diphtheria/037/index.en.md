Diphtheria is an extremely rare disease nowadays. It is rarely [found](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencediphtheria.html) even in most of the third world countries.
Since 2000, only 6 cases of diphtheria have been [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/e/reported-cases.pdf) in the USA. One of these patients [died](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5253a3.htm). He was 63 years old, and got infected in Haiti. This is such a rare disease that CDC writes up a separate report on almost every case. [[1]](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00051752.htm), [[2]](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6003a4.htm).
At the same time, 96 people have been [sick](https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html) with bubonic plague in USA since 2000. 12 of them died. Their deaths have not been widely reported, since they do not vaccinate children against the plague.
