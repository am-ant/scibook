Since the diphtheria vaccine is always combined with tetanus/whooping cough, its safety data is the same as was presented in the respective chapters.
The vaccine (without the whooping cough component) causes Guillain-Barre syndrome, anaphylactic shock and brachial neuritis, lowers the level of lymphocytes, increases the risk of allergies and antiphospholipid syndrome. From 2000 to 2017, VAERS has [registered](http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&VAX=DT&VAX=TD&VAX_YEAR_LOW=2000) 29 deaths and 181 disability cases after the diphtheria vaccine, without the whooping cough component (DT/Td). During the same time, 6 people got sick with diphtheria and one died. Considering that only 1-10% of all cases get registered with VAERS, the probability of dying from the vaccine is hundreds of times higher than the probability of getting diphtheria.
The probability of getting diphtheria in developed countries is maximum of 1 in 10 millions, and usually even less. The probability of just the anaphylactic shock is at least 1 in a million, and probability of brachial neuritis is 1 in 100 thousand.
