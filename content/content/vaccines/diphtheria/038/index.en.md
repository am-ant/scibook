Death from diphtheria in developed countries is so rare that every such case is widely [reported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria#History) in the media. In 2015, a boy died of diphtheria in Spain, and in 2008, a girl died in England. These seem to be the only deaths of children from diphtheria in developed countries in the last 30 years.
