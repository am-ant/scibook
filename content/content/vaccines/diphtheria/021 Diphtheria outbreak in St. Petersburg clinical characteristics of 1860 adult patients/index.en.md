1,860 cases of diphtheria in the Botkin hospital in St. Petersburg. Mortality rate was 2.3%. 69% of those who died were chronic alcoholics.
Among those who suffered from the toxic form of the disease, mortality rate was 26%. 6% of vaccinated patients and 14% of unvaccinated patients suffered from the toxic form. However, only those vaccinated in the last five years were considered as vaccinated.
Overall, the diphtheria mortality rate (2.3%) was relatively low, as compared to the last known epidemics. And if alcoholics were to be excluded, the mortality rate would be about 1%. Most of those who died got to the hospital at the late stages of the disease, and were either alcoholics or very busy people.
The authors conclude that diphtheria epidemic in developed countries is unlikely to have high mortality rate in the future. Also, since there was no vaccination data for the alcoholics, the authors believe that they were unvaccinated.
Vaccination provides immunity for a relatively short time. How exactly is diphtheria transmitted from person to person is not really known.
