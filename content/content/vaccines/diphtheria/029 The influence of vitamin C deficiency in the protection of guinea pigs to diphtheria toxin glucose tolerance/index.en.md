- Vitamin C deficiency causes the decreased resistance to infections and increased damages from bacterial toxins. Decreased resistance appears before the scurvy symptoms can be observed.
- Guinea pigs on a low vitamin C diet, who got injected with sublethal dose of diphtheria toxin, experienced a wider tissue damage, bigger weight loss, wider areas of necrosis, worse teeth development, and shorter lifespan, as compared to guinea pigs who were not restricted in vitamin C consumption.
Most likely, a low level of vitamin C leads to systemic disorders of the whole body, and especially the endocrine system.
The authors conclude that the level of vitamin C for detoxification from diphtheria should be significantly higher than the level of vitamin C required to prevent scurvy.
