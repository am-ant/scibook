- The role of antibacterial immunity in protection against diphtheria has not been studied since the 30s.
- Prior to the World War II, diphtheria was rarely observed in the countries of Western Europe. During the war, an epidemic started in Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, in the territories occupied by the Germans. It was the last diphtheria epidemic in developed European countries. The remaining isolated cases were observed mainly among the lower socioeconomic class.
- In the early 90s Russia, diphtheria cases among the military were observed 6 times more often that among the civilian population. In the late 80s this proportion was even higher.
- In the 90s epidemic in the former USSR countries, 83% of all cases were recorded in Russia. Most patients were adults.
The patients were mainly homeless and patients of psychiatric hospitals, living in cramped quarters and poor sanitary conditions. Among the people working under normal conditions, there were very few cases of the disease.
Children rarely got sick, but they were carriers of the disease. Economic crisis after the fall of the USSR worsened living conditions and intensified the epidemic.
Since virtually the entire population of the USSR was vaccinated, it is hard to blame the epidemic on the lack of vaccination, but the authors succeeded. After all, the article was written by the CDC.
