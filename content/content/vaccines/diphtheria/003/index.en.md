Diphtheria vaccine is not produced separately. It is always combined with tetanus (DT, Td) and usually with whooping cough (DTaP/DTP). Same as tetanus vaccine, this vaccine is a toxoid, i.e. formalin-inactivated toxin.
Antibiotics and diphtheria immunoglobulin are used as treatment. However, since diphtheria is an extremely rare disease, human immunoglobulin is not produced for it, and horse immunoglobulin is used instead, even in the developed countries..
