Since diphtheria vaccine is a toxoid, it cannot prevent the infection, but it can prevent complications from the disease. Thus, it would be logical to expect the diphtheria mortality rate to decrease with the introduction of the vaccine. However, that did not happen. Despite the fact that the number of diphtheria cases was continuously decreasing, mortality rate remained at approximately 10% level from 1920s to 1970s, despite increasing vaccination coverage.
