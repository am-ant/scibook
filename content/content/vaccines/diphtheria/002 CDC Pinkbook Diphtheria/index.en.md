Diphtheria is caused by the bacterium called Corynebacterium diphtheria, which itself is fairy harmless. However, if this bacterium is infected with a specific virus (bacteriophage), it begins to produce and secrete a strong toxin. This toxin is responsible for the severe symptoms of diphtheria. Diphtheria toxin destroys the throat tissue and forms a pseudomembrane in it, whereas without the toxin this bacterium can only cause pharyngitis. If this toxin enters the circulatory system, the complications could lead to myocarditis and temporary paralysis. The mortality rate is 5-10%.
The disease is mostly transmitted through respiratory droplets, but it can also be transmitted through contaminated objects.
Most people infected with diphtheria bacterium do not get sick, but simply become the bacteria reservoirs and carriers.
During the epidemics, most children happen to be carriers, but they do not get sick. The highest incidence of diphtheria is during winter and spring (one can already guess why).
