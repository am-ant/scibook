The concept of allergies was [unknown](http://www.allergyclinic.co.nz/history_allergy.aspx) until 1906. It was invented by an Austrian pediatrician and used to describe the strange symptoms he observed in those who received the diphtheria immunoglobulin.
The concept of anaphylactic shock also did not exist until 1902.
