In 1926, Glenny and his group experimented with the diphtheria vaccine and tried to improve its effectiveness. They accidentally found that adding aluminum to the vaccine triggers a stronger immune response. Since then, aluminum is added to most inactivated vaccines.
Glenny was not interested in the safety of having aluminum in a vaccine 90 years ago, nor does it interest anyone today.
