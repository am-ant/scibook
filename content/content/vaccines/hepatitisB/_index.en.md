Vaccinating children against hepatitis B only makes sense if you are planning on a career in prostitution for them, or if the child shows homosexual inclinations, or if you fear that the child will become a drug addict.
And even then, it makes no sense to vaccinate newborns, but would be worth waiting till the age of 18 years. The probability of contracting hepatitis B before the start of sexual activity is virtually zero.
The vaccine contains 250-550 μg of aluminum. That is, three doses of this vaccine contain 15-30 times more aluminum than all the aluminum the child will get from breast milk in six months. By the way, the fact that babies get aluminum from mother’s milk does not mean that it is normal. It means that mothers are poisoned with aluminum, which they get from food and water, and are poisoning their babies with it.
The vaccine increases risk of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, arthritis, type 1 diabetes and others.
