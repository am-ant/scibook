According Cochrane systematic review, the vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection from the mother is 72%, immunoglobulin effectiveness is 50%, and vaccine + immunoglobulin have 92% effectiveness. No statistically significant difference was found between vaccination immediately after birth and vaccination at 1 month of age. A single dose of immunoglobulin was as effective as multiple doses.
[Another study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.2187/abstract) reports that less than 4% of babies born to infected mothers contracted hepatitis B in utero. The presence of HBeAg increased the risk of infection by 17 times. That is, the risk of infection without HBeAg was less than 1%, and with HBeAg - 9.8%. HbsAg titer and the DNA virus concentration were significantly associated with intrauterine infection.
