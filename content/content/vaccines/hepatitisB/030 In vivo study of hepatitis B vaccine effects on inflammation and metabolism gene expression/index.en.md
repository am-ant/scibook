Epigenetic effect of the vaccine. Mice were given one or two hepatitis B vaccines (at the appropriate dose). One day later, they had significant changes in the expression of 144 genes in the liver. The authors analyzed 7 of them in detail. All changes were negative and led to mild liver injury, mainly due to aluminum.
