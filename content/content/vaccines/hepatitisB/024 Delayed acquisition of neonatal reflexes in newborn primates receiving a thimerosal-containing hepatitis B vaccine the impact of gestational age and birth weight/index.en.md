Newborn macaques were given a hepatitis B vaccine with thimerosal and were compared to the unvaccinated ones.
Vaccinated macaques acquired survival reflexes, as well as motor and sensory-motor reflexes much later than the unvaccinated ones. Low weight and preterm labor exacerbated the effect.
Thimerosal (ethylmercury) has not been added to the vaccines since 2003 in the USA and Western Europe, but is still used in other countries, such as Canada, [for example](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/07vol33/acs-06/index-eng.php). Not to mention Russia, Eastern Europe and third world countries.
