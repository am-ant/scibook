Three doses of the vaccine are usually given: immediately after birth, at one and six months old. This is the only vaccine that is given immediately after delivery. It is not done to prevent the possibility of contracting the infection from the mother. In the USA and other countries, all women get tested for hepatitis B before childbirth. Children of infected mothers receive immunoglobulin (antibodies) together with the vaccine.
In some countries, however, all children get vaccinated just [because](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272989X9301300103) it is much cheaper than testing all mothers.
