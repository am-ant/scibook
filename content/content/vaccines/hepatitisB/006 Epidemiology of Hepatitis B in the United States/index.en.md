Prior to the onset of the full vaccination of infants, in 1990, only 1 out of 100,000 children under the age of 15 had hepatitis B in the USA. Currently, the risk of getting infected with hepatitis B at any age under 20 years old [is](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2013surveillance/pdfs/2013hepsurveillancerpt.pdf) 0.3 in one million. In developed countries, hepatitis B is a rare disease. In Africa and Southeast Asia, it is much more common.
