There are quite a few manufacturers of this vaccine, but in developed countries, Recombivax (Merck) and Engerix-B (GSK) are most commonly used, as well as combined vaccines.
Engerix-B contains aluminum hydroxide, and Recombivax contains Amorphous Aluminum Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate (AAHS, the same adjuvant that Gardasil has). Recombivax has twice as much aluminum (500 µg vs. 250 µg). Previously, the Recombivax package insert indicated that it contains aluminum hydroxide. Now they put it this way: *0.5 mg of aluminum provided as aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, previously referred to as aluminum hydroxide.* This goes to the question how trustworthy the list of vaccine ingredients is.
Viruses for both vaccines are grown in yeast, which is why they contain 1% of yeast protein, which may well lead to a yeast allergy.
