Hepatitis B virus antigen is similar in shape to the proteins found in myelin. After vaccination, 60% of people develop a cross-reactive response to myelin proteins, which weakens over time.
This mechanism of molecular mimicry explains why multiple sclerosis can occur after hepatitis B vaccination.
Memory impairment, decreased blood cell count and brain gliosis [were observed](TBD) in mice vaccinated with Engerix-B or aluminum hydroxide. Vaccination also aggravated the course of kidney disease.
Neurobehavioral abnormalities due to pro-inflammatory processes in hippocampus, induced by the skewing of immune system into Th2, [were observed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501128) in adult mice that were vaccinated against hepatitis B as newborns.
