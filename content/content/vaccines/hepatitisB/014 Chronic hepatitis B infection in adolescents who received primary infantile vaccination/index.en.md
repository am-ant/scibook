15-year-old teenagers, vaccinated in childhood, were tested for the level of hepatitis B antibodies, and it turned out to be very low. That is, the immunity from vaccination ends before the onset of sexual activity, when it finally becomes necessary.
According to [another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15247604), antibodies already disappear by the age of five.
