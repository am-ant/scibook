In India, where hepatitis B is quite common, there is no difference in the effectiveness of the vaccine if given at birth, or at the age of six weeks.
The risk of chronic infection is 90% when infected at the age of less than one year, 30% if infected at the age of 1-5 years and 2% for adults.
The incidence of hepatitis in India is 2.4%, which should result in 250,000 deaths from hepatocellular carcinoma. However, only 5,000 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma per year are recorded in India (0.02% of all deaths), which is much less than expected.
At the age of one year, 45% of unvaccinated children had natural immunity against hepatitis B. By the age of 4-5 years the number of antibodies of vaccinated children decreased, and was only insignificantly higher than that of the unvaccinated children. The authors believe that unvaccinated children are probably protected by the motherâ€™s antibodies, which disappear only years after birth, and not withn 9 months, as is commonly believed.
The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the USA began to [rise](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1001683) rapidly in the early 90s and by 2007 it already increased more than twofold.
