773 homosexuals were given hepatitis vaccination and observed for five years.
82% had sufficient level of antibodies after the vaccination. By the end of the observation period, the antibodies disappeared in 15% of them, and decreased below the protective level in 27%.
55 contracted hepatitis, 5 became chronic patients. Those infected had 29 non-regular sexual partners on average, whereas those who did not get infected had 11.5.
