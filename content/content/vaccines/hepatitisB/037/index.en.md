In Israel, since 2005 the Israeli vaccine Sci-B-Vac has been [used](https://www.israel21c.org/hepatitis-b-no-match-for-scigens-new-vaccine). only in the center of Israel and in the south (because the entire market can not be given to one producer).In July 2015, this vaccine was [withdrawn](https://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/29072015_3.aspx). According to a statement by the Ministry of Health, it was recalled because the ampoules arrived on the machine that glued the labels too quickly, which could theoretically result in micro-cracks and bacterial contamination. the population was asked not to worry, but the vaccine was withdrawn.Two years have passed since then, but the vaccine did not return to the market, and probably could not solve the problem of sticking labels.
