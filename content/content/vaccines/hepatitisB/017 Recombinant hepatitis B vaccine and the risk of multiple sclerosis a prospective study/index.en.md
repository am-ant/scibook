Hepatitis B vaccine is associated with threefold risk of multiple sclerosis three years after vaccination.
Other studies, the ones that did not find an increased risk of multiple sclerosis in those vaccinated, are analyzed there as well. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10470051), for example, is a study, which did not find an increased risk. This is because they used the date of diagnosis, and not the date of the first symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is usually diagnosed several years after the onset of symptoms.
