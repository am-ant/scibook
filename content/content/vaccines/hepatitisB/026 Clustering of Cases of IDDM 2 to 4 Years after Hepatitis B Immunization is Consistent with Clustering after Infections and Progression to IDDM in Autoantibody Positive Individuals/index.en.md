After the start of the vaccination campaign, the number of children with type 1 diabetes in France increased by 61%, and by 48% in New Zealand. In Italy, those vaccinated against hepatitis B had type 1 diabetes 40% more often than those unvaccinated.
The increase in the number of cases of type 1 diabetes occurs 2-4 years after the vaccination have started, which hints at causal relationship.
