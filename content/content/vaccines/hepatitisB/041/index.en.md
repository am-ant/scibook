How do the vaccination advocate argue the need for this vaccination for infants? Let’s [listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hypTVwUo_IY) to Paul Offit.
His first argument is that the child can get infected from the mother while passing through the birth canal. In this case, however, the vaccine would be ineffective – the child needs immunoglobulin. In addition, all pregnant women in the USA are screened for hepatitis.
The second argument is that the child can get infected from someone else’s toothbrush, or from some uncle. This way of contracting the infection is purely theoretical. There is not a single study proving that anyone has contracted hepatitis B this way.
The third argument is that those who get the vaccine immediately after birth are more likely to finish the entire series of three vaccinations. No comments.
