80% of the infected adults show no symptoms or very mild ones, and they do not even know that they have been ill. After having been infected they get lifelong immunity.
Of the remaining 20% of those diagnosed with hepatitis B, 95% recover fully and get lifelong immunity.
Of the remaining 5%, only 25% (that is 0.25% of all those infected) will develop cirrhosis of the liver or cancer in 20-30 years after the infection. This cirrhosis or cancer does not develop because of the virus itself, but rather because of the immune response to it.
70% of patients with hepatitis B are drug addicts, gay people, alcoholics, homeless people and people with many sexual partners.
Hepatitis B [develops](http://www.mdedge.com/ccjm/article/94870/gastroenterology/hepatitis-b-virus-infection-understanding-its-epidemiology/page/0/1?channel=213) into cirrhosis or cancer mainly in alcoholics, smokers, patients with hepatitis C, obesity and diabetes.
