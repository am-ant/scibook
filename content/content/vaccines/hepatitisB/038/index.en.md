Sci-B-Vac is a third-generation vaccine, the first generation was a live vaccine, the second generation is a recombinant (genetically modified) vaccine containing virus-like particles. The third generation vaccine contains two more antigens, and therefore gives more [strong](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8779530) immune response.
The only published clinical trial of the vaccine [included](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9194109) 150 children. The vaccine [did not receive](http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000865960) a permission from the FDA. The Ministries of Health Committee report which allowed the vaccination in Israel, somewhere [disappeared](http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4690411,00.html).
Many parents argue that the children because of this vaccination had strong side effects, developmental delays, etc. What is not very surprising, since it contained twice as much aluminum, in addition, it has three antigens instead of one, which further increases the risk of autoimmune reaction. Why this will be dismantled in another part.
