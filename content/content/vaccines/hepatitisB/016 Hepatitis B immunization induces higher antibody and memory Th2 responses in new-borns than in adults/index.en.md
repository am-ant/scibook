Unlike with other vaccines, babies vaccinated against hepatitis B produce more antibodies than adults, but less interferon gamma. Meaning that the immune response in infants is biased towards the humoral immunity as compared to adults (see the chapter about whooping cough). The same was found with the oral polio vaccine.
Revaccination in adults causes a cellular immunity response, whereas in infants it does not.
Those who received BCG vaccine at birth together with hepatitis B vaccine had significantly more antibodies at the age of 12 months than those who received BCG at the age of 4.5 months.
