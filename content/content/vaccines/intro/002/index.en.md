I absolutely do not want to engage in reverse propaganda, because this is a very thankless task, but firstly, I just cannot not write about it, secondly, I write all this to organize my thoughts on this topic, and thirdly, perhaps my excessive investment of time in the study of the theme of vaccinations will help other parents make the right decision.
If you are absolutely sure that vaccinations are important, safe and effective, and want to stay like that, then please do not read further. Even with a little understanding of this topic, you will not be able to keep this confidence.
