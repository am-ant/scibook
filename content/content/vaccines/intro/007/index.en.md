The theme of vaccinations is very extensive. It cannot be understood in a few hours, or even in a few days. It is desirable to devote at least 50-100 hours to it, and even better, more still. On the one hand it's a lot of time, on the other hand, a lot of materials on vaccines are documentaries, series and video lectures. Replacing only a couple of seasons of your favorite TV series with serials, films and lectures on the theme of vaccinations, you will already provide the lion's share of the time needed to research this topic. And this will change your life much more than the regular season of the Game of Thrones.
For the number of hours that I devoted to the topic of vaccinations, I could learn a couple more foreign languages, or learn how to play the guitar skillfully. But looking back, I can say that the theme of vaccinations is probably the most important topic that I have been interested in life so far. The conclusions that follow from it go far beyond vaccinations, and even beyond the limits of medicine. Vaccine research changed my worldview, like nothing else.
