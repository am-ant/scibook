Reading the scientific research on vaccines at first glance looks very boring. Nevertheless, it was incredibly exciting. At first it feels like being a detective. You try to figure out who is good and who is bad, who is telling the truth, and who is lying. Then it looks like an anti-utopia, when you see how pharmaceutical companies manipulate doctors and scientists, doctors manipulate patients, and patients do not suspect anything, and they demand that the banquet continue. And in the end, it's like a horror novel, when you realize that this anti-utopia is real life.
