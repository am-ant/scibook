If you read any media, you probably know that in 1998, Andrew Wakefield published a study linking the MMR inoculation with autism. Subsequently, dozens of studies have been published proving that this vaccine does not cause autism, it was proved that Wakefield invented patients, and for this he was deprived of a doctor's license. All anti-vaccination arguments are based on his invented data, and only on this one withdrawn study.
All this is also a lie and will be discussed in more detail later.
