In most developed countries, vaccinations are made against the same diseases, but the number of vaccinations and vaccination schedules in different countries is very different.
In total there are approximately 15 vaccinations: hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, hemophilia B, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, rotavirus, pneumococcus, papilloma and influenza. In some countries, there are vaccinations against tuberculosis and meningococcus.
It is necessary to make a separate decision for each vaccination. All these diseases are different, some are more dangerous and less dangerous. All vaccinations are also different. There is also a big difference between vaccinations of different manufacturers, their effectiveness and side effects. There is a difference between vaccinations for the same disease in different countries. For example, ethyl mercury, a vaccine preservative that has not been used in Western countries for 25 years, is still used in Russia and in the Third World.
