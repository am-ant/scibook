But maybe anti-vaccination arguments are engaged in cherry picking? They base their decision on a thousand studies on the dangers of vaccinations, and ignore a thousand other studies proving the safety of vaccinations?
Maybe. Therefore, it is also necessary to read studies that prove that vaccinations are safe to make sure that they do not usually prove this, and to understand who is actually engaged in cherry picking. It is very important to read these studies completely, and not just the abstracts, because too often the data speak of one thing, and the conclusions speak something quite the opposite. It often happens that a placebo is not a placebo, but a neurotoxin, or another vaccine is used as a placebo. It happens that the data is skewed so that they stop being statistically significant, and from the high Odds Ratio they wave off at p-value = 0.06. It happens that the observation period is only a few days, and conclusions are made about the chronic consequences.
Paradoxically, research proving the safety of vaccinations proves their unsafe even more than studies proving their harm.
