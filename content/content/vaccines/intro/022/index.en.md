To prove that vaccinations are safe and effective, you only need to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Half the children are vaccinated with all vaccinations, and the second half is not vaccinated at all. There are no such studies, since it is considered unethical at this time not to vaccinate children. Therefore, almost all existing studies are observational studies, case reports, hypotheses, expert opinions, animal studies, etc. There are no studies that check the entire vaccination schedule. Yes, there is an entire calendar, but there is not even adequate research that verifies the safety of any one vaccination!
So when they say "vaccinations are safe and effective," then this is a priori, an unproved statement. Until such a randomized trial is conducted, the decision to vaccinate or not to vaccinate is, by definition, a choice in uncertain conditions.
