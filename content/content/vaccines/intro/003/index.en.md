Recently I talked to one relative who told me that when he had his first child, he devoted quite a lot of time to choosing a stroller, a cot, a child seat for the car, etc. But he did not spend a minute trying to figure out what vaccinations are worth or not worth doing. Almost all parents delegate the right to this decision to others. They believe that other people - scientists, doctors or nurses have already dealt with this topic, and made the best decision.
