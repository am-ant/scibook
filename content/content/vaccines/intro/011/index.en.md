It is not right to ask whether the vaccines are generally good or not. Some "experts" begin to prove that vaccinations against smallpox or yellow fever saved millions of lives. Even if this is so, it is absolutely not important. Parents do not need to make a decision about vaccination against smallpox or from yellow fever. They need to make decisions about other vaccinations.
