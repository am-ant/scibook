### Materials

Scientific research will be discussed in the following posts. But before reading the studies themselves, it is very desirable to watch a few films to get an overview of the existing problems with vaccinations, otherwise the trees will not be visible for the forest. If you have a little time, at least look the first series.

#### Films, lectures and serials

These films address common problems with vaccinations. There are a lot of very interesting films and video lectures that deal with more detailed problems of certain vaccinations, and they will be given in the future.

#### Books

1. [Dissolving Illusions: "Disease, Vaccines, and The Forgotten History"](https://www.amazon.com/Dissolving-Illusions-Disease-Vaccines-Forgotten/dp/1480216895), Suzanne Humphries
This, I think, is the most important book. The author is a nephrologist who began to investigate the topic of vaccinations, seeing complications from them in her patients. If you do not have time at all (although it is not clear what is more important to you than your health and the health of your children), then at least read this book. If you are sure that vaccines have saved the world from smallpox and poliomyelitis, or that measles and whooping cough are very dangerous diseases, after reading this book you will be sure of the opposite. The book, for the most part, explores the history of vaccinations, and contains references to hundreds of scientific articles.
The [chapter](http://humphries.s3.amazonaws.com/DissolvingIllusions-Polio.pdf) on poliomyelitis is available online for free.
2. [Miller's Review of Critical Vaccine Studies: "400 Important Scientific Papers Summarized for Parents and Researchers "](https://www.amazon.com/Millers-Review-Critical-Vaccine-Studies/dp/188121740X), Neil Z. Miller
An overview of more than four hundred scientific articles on vaccines.
3. [Vaccine Illusion](https://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Illusion-Tetyana-Obukhanych-ebook/dp/B007AW2CLG), Tetyana Obukhanych
The author is an immunologist who decided to understand why she was ill with measles, despite the fact that she was vaccinated. A very short book, read in an hour.

Having become acquainted with even a small part of the materials presented in this and in subsequent posts, you will not even have a shadow of doubt that vaccinations are several orders of magnitude more dangerous than the diseases from which they ostensibly should protect, that the decision not to vaccinate children is much more scientifically justified than the decision to vaccinate, and that vaccination, in its current form, is one of the most eerie medical inventions. Having thoroughly understood the topic, you will never voluntarily give your child any vaccinations.  

It is advisable to read the following parts in order, since most articles are based on previous ones.
