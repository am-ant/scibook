The second argument is that no one can understand this topic better than scientists from the FDA or CDC. And if these scientists claim that vaccinations are completely safe and effective, then any other opinion is, by definition, the opinion of an incompetent person.
First, it is an appeal to authority, i.e. a logical error in itself.
Secondly, the question that faces scientists from the CDC, is very different from the question that faces parents. CDC respond to the question "how to reduce the number of infectious diseases of the population with minimum risk, minimum price, and with maximum efficiency." The question that faces parents is how to "grow a maximally healthy child." These are completely different questions, and the answers to them, respectively, may turn out to be completely different.
Third, the interests of scientists, the FDA and the CDC go far beyond the "health of the population", and this will be a considerable amount of later material.
Fourthly, they do not have skin in the game. Your children's health is of interest only to you. It does not interest any doctors, nurses, pharmaceutical companies, nor, especially, scientists from the CDC. If something happens to your child due to vaccination, none of them will bear any responsibility.
