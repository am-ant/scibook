The opportunity to deal with the vaccination problem itself appeared only a few years ago thanks to the Kazakh student Alexandra Elbakyan. Before that, almost all scientific research was inaccessible to the general public, and for reading each article it was necessary to pay $30. Science was hidden from the uninitiated, sealed with seven seals. Now, thanks to the [sci-hub](sci-hub.tw) site, it is possible to find any research for free in just a few seconds, and verify with your own eyes what kind of crap some scientists are involved in.
Bless, O Lord, Alexander Elbakyan. He has done more to popularize science than all scientists and journalists combined.
