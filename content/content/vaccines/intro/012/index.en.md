Each vaccination is unique. The safety and effectiveness of each of them is completely different. There are vaccinations which are quite effective, there are those which are almost useless, and there are those whose effectiveness is negative. There are vaccinations which are safer, but there are such that God forbid.
Each vaccination should be dealt with separately. Biologically they work quite differently, and this is important. The measles vaccine is very different from the whooping cough vaccine, and both are very different from the pneumococcal vaccine.
