Many parents believe that they basically cannot deal with vaccinations, and put forward two arguments. The first argument is that a biological or medical education is needed to understand this topic.
This is not true. Vaccinations are not rocket science, and any sane person is able to understand them.
I do not even have close to a biomedical education, but my wife is a doctor, which, of course, very much helped me understand this topic. There are many biological concepts and terms which it is desirable to understand, and when there is someone who can immediately explain what CD4 is, what distinguishes CIN1 from CIN3, or IgG from IgA, it saves a lot of time. On the other hand, Wikipedia also explains all that well. In principle, a complete understanding of all these biological processes is not necessarily necessary to understand whether vaccines are safe or not.
My wife also taught me a much more important skill - the ability to critically read medical research. It turned out that reading medical research is very different from reading research in the exact sciences. There are many ways to design research, choose a control group and placebo, and play with the data so that you can prove anything.
