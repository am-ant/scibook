In addition to these two, seven more studies have been published on the association of mumps with the reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Nonetheless, the biological mechanism of this phenomenon has not been studied, and with the beginning of vaccination the connection between mumps and ovarian cancer became irrelevant, and was forgotten.
All but two of the studies found the protective effect of mumps against ovarian cancer. One of the two studies, which did not find the connection, did not even find the connection between pregnancy and ovarian cancer. The second study (the last one out of nine), was conducted in 2008, and already includes many more vaccinated people than the previous ones.
[MUC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUC1) is a membrane protein, which is associated with cancerous tumors. The authors found that women who have had mumps had much more antibodies to this protein than those who did not have mumps. This biological mechanism is what explains the protective function of mumps.
Mumps vaccine creates antibodies against the virus, but does not create antibodies against MUC1. To create these antibodies one needs to actually having mumps. Thus, it is possible to conclude that since symptomatic cases of mumps after the beginning of vaccinations are observed much less frequently, it will lead to an increase in the incidence of ovarian cancer. Indeed, the incidence of ovarian cancer among white women has already increased.
The authors also conducted a meta-analysis of the eight studies, and concluded that having had mumps decreases the risk of cancer by 19%.
