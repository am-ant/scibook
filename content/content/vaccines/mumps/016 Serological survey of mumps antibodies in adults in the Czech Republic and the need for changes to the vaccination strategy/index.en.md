Among the 18-29 years age group in Czech Republic, only 19% of those vaccinated against mumps had antibodies. Among the unvaccinated of the same age group, 48% had antibodies.
Among those unvaccinated aged 40 years and over, 63% has mumps immunity.
Despite the vaccination coverage of 98%, mumps outbreaks in Czech Republic did not stop, but rather the incidence of mumps shifted to the older age group.
