Mumps outbreak in a school where all but one of the students had been vaccinated. 54 cases in total.
There are many similar studies on mumps outbreaks among fully vaccinated. Here are a few more:

The vaccine against mumps is so ineffective, and the outbreaks among fully vaccinated are so common, that there is a special [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps_outbreaks_in_the_21st_century) on Wikipedia, listing all the mumps outbreaks in the 21st century.
