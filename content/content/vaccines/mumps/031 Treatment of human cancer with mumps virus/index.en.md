90 patients in terminal stage of cancer tried the mumps virus treatment (wild or almost wild strain). The virus was given orally, rectally, intravenously, by inhalation, by local injection, or simply by applying externally to the tumor. Since the researchers did not have enough virus, patients received only small amounts.
37 patients demonstrated very good results (the tumor disappeared completely or shrank by more than 50%), 42 patients had good results (the tumor shrank or stopped growing). Just few days later the patients had less pain and improved appetite, and within two weeks the tumor disappeared completely in many patients. Side effects were minimal. 19 patients were cured completely.
