20 years after the invention of the vaccine and 10 years after it became widely used, the first mumps outbreak (118 cases) occurred in the workplace (Chicago Futures Exchange). Total costs associated with the outbreak amounted to $120,738, whereas the vaccine costs only $4.47.
The authors report that historically, vaccine prevention of mumps did not get as much attention as the other diseases, because it is a mild one. However, $1,500 per case of mumps is too expensive, when the vaccine only costs $4.47 in public and $8.80 in private sectors. Research shows that every dollar invested in the mumps vaccine, saves $7-$14.
In addition, mumps in adults often leads to complications. 10-38% of post-pubertal men get orchitis. Also, mumps patients often develop meningitis (0.6% of cases among those aged 20 years or more). Getting mumps during the first trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage.
In pre-vaccination times, mumps outbreaks were observed mainly in prisons, orphanages and army barracks.
