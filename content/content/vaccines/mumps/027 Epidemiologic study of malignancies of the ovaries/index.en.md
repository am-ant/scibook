Unlike other types of cancer, whose risk increases with age, the risk of ovarian cancer increases till the age of 70, and then decreases sharply. The risk of ovarian cancer in Japan is much lower than in England and the US, where this type of cancer is becoming more common.
The authors analyzed the relationship between ovarian cancer and 50 different factors, and found that the only statistically significant factor associated with ovarian cancer was not having had mumps in childhood (p=0.007). In fact, not having had rubella as a child was also associated with ovarian cancer, but in this case p-value was equal to 0.02. Back then, scientists had slightly more self-respect, and p>0.01 was not considered statistically significant.
It was also found that the risk of ovarian cancer in unmarried women was significantly higher.
