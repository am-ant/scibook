Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of death among American women. 25 thousand women get diagnosed each year, and 16 thousand of them die. The authors analyzed three viruses: a recombinant measles virus and vaccine strains of mumps and measles, as treatment for ovarian cancer in vitro on mice. All three viruses successfully killed cancer cells. Despite the excellent results, they did not start using the virus as part of the conventional cancer therapy. Perhaps because this strain can cause complications of the nervous system.
The authors notice that since most people in Western countries are vaccinated against measles and mumps, the immune system can interfere with this type of therapy.
