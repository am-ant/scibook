Clinical mumps in childhood is associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Moreover, it turned out that patients with ovarian cancer had less mumps antibodies.
The authors believe that what influences the risk of ovarian cancer is not the actual mumps infection, but rather the subclinical course of the disease. In case of the subclinical disease (without symptoms, like after vaccination) less antibodies are produced, which is what subsequently protects against cancer.
