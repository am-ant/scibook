Inert substances do not exist, and no norms exist for what a placebo must consist of. This, of course, affects the results of the studies.
There is no requirement to disclose the contents of placebo used in clinical trials. Medical journals do not require this information either.
The authors analysed 167 clinical studies, published in four of the most prestigious medical journals. Most of the clinical studies did not disclose the composition of the placebo. Only studies for 8% of pills and 26% of injections reported what was used as the placebo. For example, in the study on medication for anorexia associated with cancer, it was found that the medication positively affects the GIT. However, lactose was used as the placebo. Oncological patients who are undergoing chemo and radiation therapy usually have lactose intolerance, which resulted in the medication which did not contain lactose differing favorably from the “placebo”.
