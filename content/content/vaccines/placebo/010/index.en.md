[Pediarix](https://www.gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribing_Information/Pediarix/pdf/PEDIARIX.PDF), a vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and polio (DTaP-HepB-IPV, GlaxoSmithKline). This vaccine was tested together with a vaccine for haemophilus influenzae. The control group received the vaccine Infanrix, as well as a vaccine for polio and haemophilus influenzae.

That is, roughly speaking, Pediarix was used as the placebo in the Infanrix trials, and Infanrix was used as the placebo in the Pediarix trials. All of this was seasoned with a blend of several other vaccines, in order to completely eradicate the possibility of distinguishing any side effects from the vaccine being tested.
