In 1930, two doctors from the German city of LÃ¼beck decided to vaccinate children en masse against tuberculosis with the BCG vaccine which, although it had been available since 1921, had not really been used. In the 12 months of this campaign, 208 children contracted tuberculosis due to the vaccinations, and 77 died. The doctors were arrested and convicted of murder.
This led to discussion on the use of children in medical experiments. In 2008, the USA renounced the Declaration of Helsinki. (Instead, it uses Good Clinical Practice, which does not restrict pharmaceutical companies as much as the Declaration of Helsinki).
In vaccine studies it is possible to use saline (an isotonic solution), but researchers often choose other medicines. The article cites four examples:
In the study on a vaccine for pneumococcus (PCV9), another vaccine (DTP-Hib) was used as the placebo.
In the study on a vaccine for cholera, a vaccine for E. coli was used as the placebo.
In another study on a vaccine for pneumococcus (PCV23), vaccines for hepatitis A and B were used.
In a fourth study, aluminium hydroxide mixed with thiomersal (ethylmercury) was used as the placebo.
