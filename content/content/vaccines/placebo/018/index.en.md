In order to license a new vaccine, it is quite enough for the FDA for it not to be more dangerous than any other vaccine, whether an experimental vaccine, or aluminium hydroxide, or any other substance, which the pharmaceutical company is not obligated to disclose.
**In clinical studies for vaccines, a real, inactive placebo is virtually never used.**
So next time someone claims that vaccines are completely safe, ask them in comparison to what they are completely safe.
Vaccines are only completely safe compared to other vaccines, or compared to extremely toxic substances.
