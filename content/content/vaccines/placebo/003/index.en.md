Naturally, pharmaceutical companies want to lower the odds of unsuccessful clinical trials. But do they have a legal opportunity to do so?
It turns out they do, and it is very simple. Instead of a placebo, you just need to use something which is not a real placebo, but something sufficiently toxic, which leads to the same side effects as the vaccine being tested. One of the most toxic components of vaccines is aluminium (this is shown in another section), which is used as an adjuvant in most vaccines. If, instead of a placebo, aluminium is used, or, for example, aluminium with ethylmercury, or simply another vaccine, it is possible to increase the number of side effects in the control group, and then it will be comparable to the number of side effects in the group which received the new vaccine. Thus we conclude that the new vaccine has no side effects, and it is completely safe. On the basis of these data the FDA and CDC also conclude that the vaccine is safe, and then so do all the remaining countries.
Is this legal? Absolutely.
