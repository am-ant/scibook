Due to the fact that in Guinea-Bissau children were vaccinated once in three months, it turned out to be a natural experiment. Some children have already been vaccinated by the age of 3-5 months, and some havenâ€™t.
The risk of death in children vaccinated against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTP) was 10 times higher than that of the unvaccinated children. Children who were also vaccinated against poliomyelitis (OPV) died only 5 times more often that the unvaccinated children.
After vaccination started, infant mortality at the age over 3 months increased by 2 times.
The author of the study concludes that the vaccine against diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis kills more children than it saves.
The authors can hardly be accused of being anti-vaccination. [Peter Aaby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Aaby), one of the authors of the study, created [Bandim Health Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandim_Health_Project) in Guinea-Bissau, one of the main goals of which is to vaccinate children.
