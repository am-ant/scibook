Macaques were given childhood vaccines according to the vaccination schedule in USA in 1999 and were compared with the unvaccinated macaques.
The vaccinated macaques had a much larger brain volume (this [is observed](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/nature21369.html) in autistic children).
The amygdala (brain region responsible for emotions) was much larger in the vaccinated macaques, than the unvaccinated ones. (This also [is observed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15254095) in autistic children).
