The study compares vaccinated and undervaccinated children in the USA. Undervaccinated are the children who have not received at least one vaccine, or received at least one vaccine even one day later than the prescribed time limit.
Those who were undervaccinated by their parentsâ€™ choice used emergency care 9% less often, visited doctors 5% less often, and also had pharyngitis and URTI 11% less often.
The number of undervaccinated children is steadily increasing (from 42% in 2004 to 54% in 2008).
