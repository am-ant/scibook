11% of doctors did not recommend their patients vaccinate their children with all vaccines.
Doctors-therapists did not recommend inoculation twice as often as pediatricians did (therapists earn less on vaccinations).
Doctors trust medical journals more than the CDC and the FDA. They trust pharmaceutical companies less than the Internet. (USA)
