Most people believe that a doctor can treat as he sees fit. Far from it. If, for example, a doctor read several scientific articles and came to the conclusion that it is better to treat a certain disease in some other way, he has no right to do so. The doctor must follow the permitted treatment protocols, otherwise he will lose his license. If the doctor advises the patient about any unapproved medicine, for example, to treat whooping cough with vitamin C, and not with an antibiotic, and something happens to the patient, the doctor will go to court. If the doctor prescribes antibiotics ([not particularly effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15674946) in whooping cough), and something happens the patient, the doctor will not bear any responsibility. What is the point of the doctor advising the patient something that is not approved by the protocol?
Similarly, the doctor, by and large, does not have the right to advise the patient not to get vaccinated. He may very quickly lose his license (especially in the USA), and even if he does not lose it, his career will not go far.
Nevertheless, there are many doctors openly opposing vaccinations. Of course, these are always doctors with their own private practice.
