My wife also thought vaccines were safe and effective. They were taught this. I asked her how many hours during the whole period of her training she had, had been devoted to vaccinations. It turned out that only a few hours. Of these, for two hours they taught about the vaccination schedule, and for another two hours there was a lecture on "how to respond to anti-vaccination arguments." By the way, after this lecture, almost all the students said that the lecturer's arguments did not convince them, and that the arguments of the anti-vaccinations were more convincing. They, of course, did not think that the anti-vaccine handlers were somehow right. They decided that the lecturer simply did not prepare well for this lecture.
