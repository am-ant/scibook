Probiotics may help in the treatment of cervical dysplasia.
[Vitamins C, A, E](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375804), [vitamin D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28471122), [group B vitamins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14682443), [green tea extract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14512803), [turmeric](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24289574) and [healthy vaginal flora](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27802830) significantly reduce the risk of dysplasia.
That is, if you do not smoke, do not take oral contraceptives, eat well, do not destroy vaginal microflora with douching chemicals, get pap-smears once in a while, then the risk of cervical cancer, which is already very low, is reduced to almost zero without any vaccinations.
