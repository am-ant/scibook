The process of licensing a new drug is quite long. Some drugs, however, get exceptions from the FDA and are licensed much faster, if there is reason to believe that they are very effective, safe, better than the drugs already on the market, and will improve the public health. This is called fast track. The licensing process of Gardasil went down this path and took only six months.
This article analyses the approval process of Gardasil and proves that Gardasil does not meet any of the four criteria required to get the fast track.
