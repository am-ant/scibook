In clinical trials of both vaccines, aluminum was used instead of a placebo. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the real number of side effects from these trials. This is the [document](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM111274.pdf) Merck provided for the FDA approval of Gardasil. 20,000 girls participated in the vaccine trails. 75% of the young girls and girls of the ages of 9-26 developed some kind of new diseases during the three years of the trial (page 137). Whether it is many or not, you decide for yourself.
However, one small control group of the girls in the Gardasil trials received saline, not aluminum. Although this saline also contained other components of the vaccine, apart from aluminum: the already familiar Polysorbate 80, yeast protein, borax and L-histidine. L-histidine is a histamine precursor, which we will talk about another time.
The existence of this small group allows Merck to claim that not only aluminum was used as a placebo, but also saline. As for the other components of this saline solution â€“ they usually stay modestly silent. You will not find this information in the vaccine package insert, for example. But you can find it [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17484215).
However, the data on side effects of this group compared to other groups is hidden. Merck summarized the serious side effects of all control groups together.
