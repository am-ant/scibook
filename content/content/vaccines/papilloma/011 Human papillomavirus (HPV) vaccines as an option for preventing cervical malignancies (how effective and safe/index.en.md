This article analyzes clinical trials of HPV vaccines. The article is long, but very informative, and is worth reading in full.
- PAP smear is a test that determines whether one has dysplasia. In developed countries where it is widely used, the risk of death from cervical cancer is very low (1.4/100,000 women). 90% of deaths from cervical cancer are recorded in third world countries. (The risk of disease is also very low â€“ 7/100,000 women. Moreover, the death rate from cervical cancer continues to fall rapidly. In the 90s, without any vaccinations, it decreased by half.)
- An even bigger reduction of mortality from cervical cancer due to vaccinations in the developed countries is highly unlikely.
*Effectiveness:*
- Since the development of cervical cancer takes decades, and pharmaceutical companies do not want to wait so long, surrogate markers (i.e. dysplasia CIN 1-3, which develop faster) are used instead of cancer in vaccine clinical trials. But since the vast majority of these dysplasias pass on their own, they are a pretty bad marker for cervical cancer.
- The test for dysplasia, especially CIN 2, is very imprecise, which also makes it a bad marker.
- Therefore, the effectiveness of a vaccine, determined on the basis of dysplasia, is not an indication of the effectiveness of the vaccine against cervical cancer.
- Analyzing clinical trials, the effectiveness of Gardasil in preventing CIN 2-3, associated with any strain of HPV, was only 14-17%. (This is the actual effectiveness of the vaccine. But even this number is too high, as dysplasia does not always develop into cancer.)
- Effectiveness of the vaccine for those, who have already been infected with HPV, was negative (from -33% to -44%). That is, for those already infected, vaccine increases the risk of dysplasia. These results were not mentioned in the article published my Merck. Nonetheless, FDA does not require testing for the infection before vaccinating.
- Prevention of CIN 1-3 from 16/18 strains was at 100%. The statistical significance of these results, however, is rather doubtful. First of all, the confidence interval is very wide. The vaccine prevented 3 cases of CIN 1-3 in one group, and 7 cases in the other. Second of all, CIN 1 develops into cancer only in 1% of the cases. However, since the number of CIN 1 cases is much higher compared to the CIN 2-3 cases, summing up CIN 1 with CIN 2-3 completely distorts the statistics.
- The authors further analyze clinical trials of the Cervarix vaccine, with similar conclusions.
- After 7 years, the effectiveness of Cervarix in preventing CIN 2 was only 40.6%, with the confidence interval (-106.0 to 84.7) (no statistical significance).
*Safety:*
- From 2006 to 2012 more than 20,000 cases of adverse events of this vaccine have been reported in the USA, 8% of them were serious ones. 73 people died, 581 became disabled. Since the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is passive, it records only 1% to 10% of all cases, according to various estimates. Therefore, the real amount of adverse events is 10-100 times higher.
- Out of all vaccine adverse events in girls aged 6-29 years, 65% of all serious adverse events are due to HPV vaccine.
- 82% of disability cases of women under 30 are associated with HPV vaccine.
- In Australia the amount of serious adverse events increased to 85% and due to HPV vaccination. The same is happening is other countries as well.
- In the Cervarix study, which included 9,000 women, 8% had serious adverse event, 32% had significant adverse event, 9% had a spontaneous abortion, 3% got a new chronic disease. Same adverse events were observed in the control group (which received the same vaccine, only without the antigen).
- In the UK, adverse events from Cervarix were observed 8 times more often than from the MMR vaccine.
