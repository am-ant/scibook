Cervical cancer develops very slowly; it is a process that [takes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23016780) 20-40 years (although rapid development is [possible](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(99)70256-5/abstract)). It is preceded by [cervical dysplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_intraepithelial_neoplasia).
Cervical dysplasia is the presence of atypical cells in the cervix. There are tree types of dysplasia: CIN 1 (mild dysplasia), CIN 2 (moderate dysplasia), CIN 3 (severe dysplasia).
Having dysplasia does not mean that cervical cancer is inevitable.
Only 1% of CIN 1 develops into cancer; only 5% of CIN 2 develops into cancer; only 12-32% of CIN 3 develops into cancer.
