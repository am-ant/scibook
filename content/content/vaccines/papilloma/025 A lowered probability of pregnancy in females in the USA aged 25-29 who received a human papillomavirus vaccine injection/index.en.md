The birth rate in the USA decreased by 11.5% since 2007, even though itâ€™s been rising since 1995.
Married women at the ages of 25-29, who received the HPV vaccine, got pregnant 3 times less often than those who did not get vaccinated.
Among all women, the ones that got one dose got pregnant 2.4 times less often, and those who got three doses got pregnant 3.2 times less often, as compared to the women unvaccinated against HPV.
In [another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28881394) a connection between the HPV vaccine and infertility has not been found. However, this study compared young vaccinated women to older unvaccinated women. Neither did the study analyze the number of doses received by the women.
