For the longest time I could not understand how they managed to create such a dangerous vaccine. After all, unlike most vaccines that are given to small children with an undeveloped immune system, this vaccine is given to older children and adults. Then why is it that the number of side effects of this particular vaccine is so overwhelming? Vaccination advocates have a simple answer to this question. According to them, this happens because older children and adults, unlike babies, can speak.
Babies can only express themselves through crying, and crying could be attributed to anything. If a 16-year-old girl starts fainting, stops thinking straight and cannot continue studying, itâ€™s impossible not to notice, and impossible to write off to genetic factors. And if a baby stops thinking straight, it only becomes visible years later and it can be concluded that the baby was born that way.
