The authors analyzed the symptoms of 53 girls after the vaccination. Common symptoms were headaches, orthostatic intolerance, fainting, weakness, cognitive disorders, insomnia, irregular menstrual cycle, tremor, twitching, difficulty walking, stomachache, chest pain and neuropathic pains, etc. None of the girls had any chronic diseases before the vaccination.
The symptoms started, on average, 11 days after the vaccination. Before vaccination all patients were professionally involved in sports. After the vaccination 98% of them could not function normally, 75% had to quit studies or jobs for at least two months.
A [similar study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274229) of 44 girls in Japan.
