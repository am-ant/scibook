One of the components of Gardasil in ‘Polysorbate 80’. It’s an emulsifier that is often used in food and cosmetics, and is considered safe enough to be used in vaccines as well. Although, of course, no one checked for its safety in vaccines. In a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8473002) on rats, however, it turned out that when newborn rats are injected with Polysorbate 80 their oestrus cycle is disrupted (increase from 4.3 to 9-14 days). In addition, they had low ovarian weight, abnormal uterus cytology, enlarged uterus and accelerated aging of the reproductive organs.
