The authors analyzed the serious adverse events of Gardasil in the USA. The vaccine is associated with an increase in the risk of gastroenteritis by 4.6 times, arthritis – 2.5 times, systemic lupus – 5.3 times, vasculitis – 4 times, alopecia – 8.3 times, nervous system diseases – 1.8 times.
Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) starts, on average, 6 days after the vaccination, lupus – 19 days later, arthritis – after 55 days.
