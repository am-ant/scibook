In the early 1980s, premature babies were injected intravenously with a drug containing vitamin E. It was associated with pulmonary insufficiency, hepatomegaly, cholestatic jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, renal insufficiency, azotemia and thrombocytopenia. At least 38 babies [died](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/27/weekinreview/the-tragic-case-history-of-intravenous-vitamin-e.html).
It turned out that Polysorbate 80, contained in the drug, was responsible for these side effects.
