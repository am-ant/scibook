Another study proving the low effectiveness of Gardasil and negative effectiveness for those already infected with HPV.
Regarding the negative effectiveness of the vaccine for those already infected, the CDC [writes](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm): “The vaccine is less effective in preventing HPV-related disease in young women who have already been exposed to one or more HPV types. ‘Less effective’, according to CDC, means negative effectiveness. However, they are technically right. Negative effectiveness, indeed, is less than the positive. Remember this the next time you read CDC recommendations.
And this is what the National Cancer Institute (which owns several patents for the production of this vaccine) [writes](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet) on their website: “It is likely that someone exposed to HPV will still get some residual benefit from vaccination, even if he or she has already been infected with one or more of the HPV types included in the vaccines.” Decide for yourself whether the National Cancer Institute is interested in reducing the number of cancer patients.
But maybe FDA is not aware of the negative effectiveness of Gardasil? They are very much aware of it ([page 13](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ij4vW0idErIJ:https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4222B3.pdf)).
