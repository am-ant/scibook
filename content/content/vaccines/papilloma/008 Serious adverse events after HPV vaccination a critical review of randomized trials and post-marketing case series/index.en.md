Analysis of clinical and post-clinical trials of the vaccine:
- In most clinical studies, an inert placebo was not used;
- In two largest clinical trials the number of serious negative cases reported was significantly higher in the group that received the vaccine;
- In the group that received Cervarix, 14 deaths were recorded, while the group that got the placebo only three girls died;
- In the group that received Gardasil-9 the number of serious negative cases reported was significantly higher than in the group that got regular Gardasil (3.3% vs. 2.6%).
To prevent one case of dysplasia that is not prevented by Gardasil, 1,757 girls need to be vaccinated with Gardasil-9. To cause an additional serious negative case 140 girls need to be vaccinated with Gardasil-9. Meaning that the chance of Gardasil-9 causing harm is 12.5 times higher than the chance of it doing good, as compared to Gardasil.
- Almost all serious adverse events in clinical trials were regarded as not related to the vaccine.
- A study conducted in Valencia showed that 10 times more adverse events are recorded for the HPV vaccines as compared to other vaccines (1:1000). The authors suggested that it might be due to the bad PR of this vaccine. 32% of the adverse events were serious.
- Japan suspended vaccination in response to the adverse events.
