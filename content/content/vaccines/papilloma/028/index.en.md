According to the [toxicology report](http://indenta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tween-80.pdf) of the manufacturer, Polysorbate 80 is a carcinogen and causes DNA mutations. Also, judging by the animal testing, it causes cardiac changes, psychological changes, and weight loss. Whether it penetrates the skin is unclear, but that does not prevent it from being widely used in soaps, shampoos and other cosmetics.
Polysorbate 80 can [cause](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16400901) anaphylactic shock.
