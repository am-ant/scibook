HPV is transmitted mainly through sexual contact, but it can [also](http://jcm.asm.org/content/43/1/376.full) be contracted from parents and friends. Most people contract it at some point in their lives and in 90% of the cases the virus passes on its own, without any symptoms, and only in 0.15% of the cases the virus leads to cervical cancer.
There are over 170 strains of papillomavirus. 17 of them are potentially oncogenic, some only cause warts.
