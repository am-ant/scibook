HPV and cervical cancer could be compared to aluminum and Alzheimer’s disease. Despite the fact that many scientists understand that aluminum plays a major role in the occurrence of the disease, admitting to it would not benefit anyone. It would not benefit the aluminum industry, or the cosmetics industry, or the pharmaceutical industry, all of which will lose hundreds of millions in profits, and will have to payout huge compensations. Neither does it benefit the governments, whose countries’ economies will suffer because or this, nor does it benefit the scientists, who will lose their scarce grants and who do not wish to become another Wakefield. It would not benefit even the [Alzheimer’s Association](http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_myths_about_alzheimers.asp), which will lose its financing as soon as the cause of the disease is determined.
The recognition of HPV as the sole factor in cervical cancer, however, does benefit everyone: the pharmaceutical industry, the governments and even the scientists. HPV vaccine created a new multi-billion dollar market that has not existed before [out of thin air](http://www.pharmexec.com/brand-year-0).
