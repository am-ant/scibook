But there is another answer. New types of aluminum salts were used as adjuvants in these vaccines. Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and aluminum phosphate (AlPO<sub>4</sub>) were discussed in the aluminum chapter. But there are new, more potent aluminum adjuvants.
Amorphous Aluminum Hydrophosphate Sulfate (AAHS) was used in Gardasil. Gardasil-9 has 2.2 times more of this aluminum than the previous version of the vaccine (500 Î¼g).
Adjuvant system 04 (AS04) was used in Cervarix. It is aluminum hydroxide mixed with salmonella endotoxin.
Of course, no one has conducted any studies on the safety of these new adjuvants. Despite numerous studies proving its toxicity, aluminum is [recognized](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/gras/scogs/ucm260848.htm) by the FDA as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe). This means that its new compounds are also safe enough to be added to vaccines.
