- Despite the fact that HPV vaccine is positioned as vaccine against cervical cancer, to this day it has not prevented a single case of cancer, let alone cancer death.
- The long-term benefits of this vaccine are based on theoretical assumptions, rather than on research. (It has not been established that the immunity will last for decades).
- Side effects from it include seizures, paralysis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse myelitis, facial neuritis, anaphylactic shock, deep vein thrombosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, cervical cancer and death.
- In developed countries, more people suffer from serious side effects of HPV vaccines than die of cervical cancer. Although this comparison is not entirely correct. It should be remembered that this vaccine is given to children; therefore, even if this vaccine was very effective and prevented all 70% of cases of cancer from HPV 16 and 18 strains, this cancer would develop only decades later. Should the theoretical risk of getting cervical cancer at the age of 50 be exchanged for the practical risk of lifelong paralysis, autoimmune disease or death at the age of 9?
