Three HPV vaccines are currently available. Gardasil (Merck) is a tetravalent vaccine (protects against types 6, 11, 16, 18) and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline) is bivalent (protects against types 16 and 18). Types 16 and 18 are oncogenic and ‘responsible’ for 70% of the cases of cervical cancer, while types 6 and 11 cause warts. Since 2014 there is also a new, nine-valent vaccine – Gardasil-9.
This vaccine is usually given to children starting at the age of 9, boys and girls, in three doses. In 2016 CDC [recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6549a5.htm) reducing the number of doses to two. In 2018 discussions regarding reducing the number of doses to just one [have started](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/vaccine/vol/36/issue/32/part/PA).
The vaccines contain recombinant (genetically modified) virus-like particles.
