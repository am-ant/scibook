Despite the fact that HPV-16 and 18 play a major role in the development of cervical cancer, contracting HPV is neither a necessary nor a sufficient factor in causing cervical cancer.
- HPV is found in only 90% of the tumors, and therefore that causal relationship between them does not satisfy Koch’s first postulate
- in 1970s researchers believed that it was the herpes virus (HSV-2) that was responsible for this disease
Those with HPV get cervical cancer 4.3 times more often than those who do not have the virus. But those who have both viruses (HPV and herpes) get cancer 8.8 times more often.
- In another study HPV was found in 77% of the cancer patients. Among those who did not have HPV, herpes was found 3.6 times more often.
- Smoking significantly increases the risk of cervical cancer (even after adjusting for sexual behavior and socioeconomic status).
- Vaginal douching also significantly increases the risk of cervical cancer. Commercial douching products use tar. The risk of cervical cancer for those using commercial products is 2.4 times higher. For those who use vinegar and water the risk does not increase. Tar is also used in cigarettes and is a known carcinogen.
- African American women get cervical cancer twice as often. They also douche twice as often.
- Contraceptive pills increase the risk of cervical cancer threefold. Intrauterine device – by 1.6 times. Condoms, diaphragms, foams and jellies reduce the risk of cancer. [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25081657).
The authors conclude that the cause of cervical cancer is the interaction between viruses (especially HPV and HSV-2) and tar (smoking and douching).
