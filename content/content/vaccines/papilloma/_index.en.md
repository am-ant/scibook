It's not the fact that HPV causes cervical cancer.
In most cases, HPV passes by itself without any symptoms.
The risk of cervical cancer in developed countries is very low (7/100,000) , and continues to decline rapidly.
The vaccine has not prevented any case of cancer so far. (hello, evidence-based medicine)
The vaccine increases the risk of cervical dysplasia by 44% in already infected with HPV, that is, it is contraindicated to nedevstvennitsam. too, because they could well get infected from parents or friends.
Vaccine Container Gardasil also contains polysorbate 80, which leads to rapid aging of reproductive organs.
There are no safety studies for vaccines that use the real placebo.
There are more effective and safer methods of preventing cervical cancer (Pap test, LEEP). Vaccination is especially dangerous for athletes.
