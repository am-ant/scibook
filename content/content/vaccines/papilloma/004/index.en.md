How is it usually determined that a specific virus (or other pathogen) is the cause of a specific disease?
Theoretically, [Koch’s postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch's_postulates) are usually used. The causal link between HPV and cervical cancer does not meet the requirements of the Koch’s postulates.
In practice, this does not mean much, as even Koch himself understood the limitations of his postulates.
In reality, there are currently no generally accepted criteria for establishing a causal relationship in medicine. Statistical methods are usually used, but statistics can be used to prove anything.
Wikipedia [cites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch's_postulates) new Koch’s postulates, which were proposed for the 21st century. However, they state that these postulates are quite controversial, as according to them, HPV is not the cause of cervical cancer, even though everyone knows that it is.
So whether HPV is the cause of cervical cancer or not is far from being settled science.
