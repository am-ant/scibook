In May 2018, Cochrane [published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29740819) a systemic review of randomized studies of HPV vaccines.
In late July, another Cochrane group published an article criticizing this review:
1) The review only included 26 out 46 studies that met the criteria.
2) All these studies used aluminum adjuvants or hepatitis vaccines as placebo.
3) The number of serious side effects in the review did not match the published data. The authors also forgot to report that some studies did not record serious side effect that happened 14 days after the vaccination.
4) The authors of the review planned on asking the manufacturers for the missing, unpublished data, but did not do it due to lack of time, although it has been 7 years between the publication of the protocol and the publication of the review.
5) The review stated that all but one studies were funded by the vaccine manufacturers. However, that’s not exactly true. The last, 26th study, was also funded by the manufacturer.
6) Most of the 14 authors of the protocol had a conflict of interest. The first author of the review also had a conflict of interest, as he was the head of observing post-marketing effects of HPV vaccination in Europe, which is sponsored by Sanofi-Pasteur (which also manufactures Gardasil).
7) The authors of the review mention many observational studies, but for some reason forget to mention the WHO study published in 2017, which reveals serious diseases after the vaccination.
8) The risk of death among the vaccinated was 2.36 times higher than among those who got the placebo. The authors of the review conclude that such result was accidental, despite it being statistically significant.
The authors of the article are worried that some might begin to perceive the Cochrane organization the same way as medical journals are perceive today – as a marketing department for the pharmaceutical industry.
