A very interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRyz56hhRto), which explains in more detail about these new adjuvants. It explains what exactly is meant by ‘amorphous’, and how it affects the fact that each dose of the vaccine has a different amount of antigen, and why AAHS cannot be patented (it is unstable). It also speaks about the fact that the same adjuvant was used in the DTP vaccine (which is no longer used in developed countries because the side effects were too frequent), as well as in other vaccines against hepatitis (in the insert to which Merck forgot to mention this ingredient).
