In the period from 2006 to 2017, [after](http://sanevax.org/vaers-report/) being vaccinated against HPV in USA, 14,518 people went to ER, 4,795 were hospitalized, 1,924 became disabled, 324 died, 279 developed cervical dysplasia, 618 had abnormal pap smears and 129 got cervical cancer. (Data taken from VAERS, i.e. include about 1-10% of all cases).
Three of the deceased [were](http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&GROUP2=AGE&VAX=HPV2&VAX=HPV4&VAX=HPV9&VAX=HPVX&VAXTYPES=HPV) children under the age of three, three of the disabled were children under the age of 6, and 17 children under the age of 3 were hospitalized. All of them got this vaccine by mistake, as did at least 320 more children under the age of 9, who this vaccine was not intended for.
