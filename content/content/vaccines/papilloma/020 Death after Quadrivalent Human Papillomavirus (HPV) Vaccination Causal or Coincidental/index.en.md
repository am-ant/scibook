Two girls died after getting the HPV vaccine. The first girl died at the age of 19, 6 months after receiving the third vaccine. The second girl died at the age of 14, two weeks after receiving the second vaccine. Both had autopsies, which did not reveal any pathologies.
The authors of the study analyzed the samples of the girls’ brain tissue and discovered that they both had autoimmune cerebral vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels of the brain), caused by the HPV-16 antibodies. They also found virus-like vaccine particles HPV-16L1 themselves, stuck on the blood vessels of the brain.
Accumulating immune cells in brain tissue could happen in one of the 3 cases:
1) brain infection;
2) brain injury;
3) overstimulation of immune system (e.g. through vaccination).
Given the girls’ medical histories and results of the autopsies it is clear that only the third option applies.
The brain is very sensitive to reduction in blood supply (ischemia). Therefore, nervous system vasculitis left untreated easily leads to permanent disability. Cerebral vasculitis is considered to be a relatively rare disease. But this is because its symptoms are unstable and it is hard to diagnose. The symptoms include headaches, orthostatic intolerance, dizziness, fainting, tremor, tingling, weakness, cognitive and motor disorder, etc. Both girls showed most of these symptoms.
