This articles compares the immune response to these new adjuvants with aluminum hydroxide on mice. The authors happily conclude that both of the new adjuvants induce an immune response 3-8 greater than the immune response to aluminum hydroxide. For some reason they never mention that eightfold immune response also means an eightfold risk of the autoimmune response.
