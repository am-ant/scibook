In Britain, pertussis vaccine coverage fell after the year 1975. Pertussis-related hospitalization declined between 1970-1983, and no cases of pertussis-induced encephalopathy, brain damage, lung damage, or death were reported between 1975-1982. There was no evidence of herd immunity, sufficient to protect babies.
The author of this study concludes that the risks related to pertussis vaccination are higher than the risks of whooping cough itself for people living in affluent areas of Britain. For people living in poorer areas, the incidence of pertussis is slightly higher, but there is still no evidence that pertussis is associated with excessive deaths or chronic complications.
