This study is a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy between three and five doses of DTaP. The authors concluded that five doses of the vaccine are not more effective than three doses and that the vaccine is valid for only three years (this means that after three years, 50% of vaccinated children are no longer immune). After vaccination, the risk of contracting pertussis increases by 33% each year. In fact, three years is a long time considering an initial effectiveness of 85% was assumed. According to studies mentioned in the previous article (Geier), the effectiveness of the acellular vaccine is about 60%. Pregnant women, for example, according to the recommendations of the CDC, should be vaccinated against whooping cough every pregnancy, even if only one year passed after the previous pregnancy. The authors conclude that five doses of the vaccine are not enough, and that one more dose should be administered.
