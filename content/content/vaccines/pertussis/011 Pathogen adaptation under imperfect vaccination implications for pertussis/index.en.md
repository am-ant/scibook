While the number of cases of whooping cough among unvaccinated individuals has increased, the number of cases among vaccinated individuals has increased even more. Most cases of whooping cough happen among vaccinated.
Also, according to [data](http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2013.pdf) from the CDC, most patients with pertussis-induced whooping cough have been vaccinated.
