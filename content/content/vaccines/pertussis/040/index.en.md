The acellular vaccine, of course, is much less dangerous than the whole-cell vaccine, but, nevertheless, [according to](http://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&VAX[]=DTAP&VAX[]=DTAPH&VAX[]=DTAPHEPBIP&VAX[]=DTAPIPV&VAX[]=DTAPIPVHIB&VAX[]=TDAP&VAX[]=TDAPIPV&SERIOUS=ON&VAX_YEAR_LOW=2002&VAX_YEAR_HIGH=2017) VAERS, 1,077 people have died after being administered this vaccine in the USA since 2002. Moreover, 1,009 became invalid, 8,700 were hospitalized, but less than 200 people died from whooping cough itself (note: of these individuals some had been vaccinated). In other words, the risk of dying from vaccination is at least five times higher than the risk of dying from whooping cough. Since the VAERS figures should be multiplied by at least 10, the risk of dying from vaccination is 50 times higher than from the disease.
