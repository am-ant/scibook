How is the effectiveness of vaccines measured during clinical trials? Scientists cannot simply vaccinate children, infect them, and then see how many of them become ill. As such, the effectiveness of vaccines is measured by the number of antibodies that the immune system produces in response to vaccination. In the case of whooping cough (as is the case for other vaccines), we see that the opposite is true: the more antibodies the immune system produces, the higher the probability of contracting the disease. Therefore, one of the recommendations of the authors of the previous article is to reduce the amount of antigen in vaccines. Even the CDC [states](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5704a1.htm) that there is no correlation between the number of antibodies and the level of protection against pertussis.
That is, there is a big difference between the clinical effectiveness of the vaccine and its effectiveness during clinical trials. The more effective the pertussis vaccine looks during clinical trials, the less effective it is in reality, since the stronger it shifts immunity toward Th2.
