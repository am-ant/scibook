This is [an example](https://www.facebook.com/9NewsPerth/videos/1701725426506277/) of doctors refusing to diagnose whooping cough among vaccinated individuals. A mother repeatedly took her two children to various doctors in Australia as they both presented classic pertussis symptoms. However, all doctors refused to check the children for whooping cough and paid no attention to the mother. After two months of symptoms however, the children were finally tested and it turned out that they indeed had whooping cough.
