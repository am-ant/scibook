Another component of the pertussis acellular vaccine is pertactin. Pertactin is a protein normally located in the membrane of the pertussis bacterium. In countries where the acellular vaccine is used, the bacterial responsible for whooping cough are generally the pertussis without pertactin. Here are the studies of this phenomenon in [Finland](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485885/), [United States](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5115783/), [Japan](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031985) and [Australia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1478_article), where strains without pertactin almost completely replaced strains with pertactin in just four years.
A non-pertactin strain is more [invasive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19579693) than a normal strain. More: [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25301209), [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26432908).
