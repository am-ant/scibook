An article by a British doctor states that, according to his long-term experience, whooping cough hasn't disappeared. In fact, after vaccination was implemented, whooping cough only disappeared from official records because doctors stopped diagnosing it.
[This article](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/119/1/135/56509/RE-WHOOPING-COUGH-AND-WHOOPING-COUGH-VACCINE-THE) reports that even though vaccination coverage against pertussis in England fell from 78% to 49% between the 1960s and the 1970s, whooping cough-related mortality during this same period decreased 3-fold.
