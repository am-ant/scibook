As the pertussis vaccine is extremely inefficient, and whooping cough can be very dangerous, primarily for infants, scientists from the CDC decided that as soon as a new baby was born into a family, the entire family should be vaccinated. They recommended that mothers, fathers, siblings, and grandparents, as well as everyone else who comes into contact with the child, should be vaccinated in order to create a cocoon around the child. This is called [cocooning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocooning_(immunization)) and aims to prevent any pertussis bacterium breaking through and causing infection in the child. In fact, although this strategy has been used since 2005, the number of cases of whooping cough has not decreased.
[This article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3922557) explains that although pharmaceutical companies claim that cocooning is the most effective vaccination strategy, in reality, more than 10,000 people need to be vaccinated to prevent one hospitalization, and more than a million people need to be vaccinated in order to prevent one death. This is undoubtedly a very effective strategy for pharmaceutical companies. In the study, they fail to mention that some parents [become disabled](https://au.news.yahoo.com/video/watch/33711079/father-suing-wa-government-over-whooping-cough-vaccination/) after getting vaccinated against whooping cough.
According to some studies, the acellular vaccine [increased](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/) the number of asymptomatic cases of whooping cough about 30 times, and this explains why cocooning does not work.
