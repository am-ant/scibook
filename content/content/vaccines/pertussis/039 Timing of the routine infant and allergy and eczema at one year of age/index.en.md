Girls who received the first dose of DTaP at least one month after the suggested term developed allergies four times less frequently than girls who were vaccinated on time. Both boys and girls developed eczema two times less often if they were vaccinated at least one month after the programmed date.
[Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17224216) it is also reported that vaccinated mice developed lung pathologies.
