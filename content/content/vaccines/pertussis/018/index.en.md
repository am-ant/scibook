As mentioned above, there is a "new definition of whooping cough" as notified by the World Health Organization. When a new vaccine appears on the market, the definition of a disease usually changes. For example, while before 1991 it was necessary to hear the characteristic cough, detect the presence of antibodies, or detect the presence of the pertussis bacteria to diagnose pertussis, after 1991 (when the clinical studies of the acellular vaccine began), these observations were [no longer sufficient](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/66921/1/MIM_EPI_PERT_91.1.pdf); it became necessary that the cough last for at least three weeks. Without a strong three-week cough, whooping cough is now no longer diagnosed as whooping cough. This new definition obviously led to a sharp decrease in the number of patients being diagnosed with whooping cough, and as a consequence, the apparent effectiveness of the vaccine appeared to be high. Similarly, as soon as the polio vaccine came onto the market, the definition of the disease immediately changed. This too resulted in fewer patients being diagnosed with polio. Surprisingly, everyone thinks that the vaccine saved us from the polio epidemic, ignoring that the disease fell under a new definition.
