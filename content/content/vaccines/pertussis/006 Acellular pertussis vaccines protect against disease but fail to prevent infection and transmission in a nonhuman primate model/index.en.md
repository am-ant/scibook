This is one of the most important studies because not only was it conducted by the FDA, but it also directly compares vaccinated subjects with unvaccinated ones, albeit baboons. The baboons were divided into four groups: the first group received three doses of a whole-cell vaccine, the second group received three doses of an acellular vaccine, the third group was not vaccinated, and the fourth group consisted of baboons that were not vaccinated but had previously been infected by pertussis. A month after administration of the last booster dose, all four groups were infected with pertussis and the infection monitored. While the whole-cell, acellular and unvaccinated groups remained infected for 18, 35 and 30 days respectively, the previously infected, unvaccinated group resisted infection altogether.
Although the unvaccinated group had much more bacteria in the first two weeks compared to the two vaccinated groups, the acellular group remained infected for longer. This was true even though the acellular group had developed more antibodies against pertussis than the group that had previously been infected (we will come back to this point later on).
Thus, it appears that no type of pertussis vaccine – when administered in three doses – is able to prevent pertussis infection.
It has also been reported that during clinical trials of acellular pertussis vaccines, participants were tested for infection with whooping cough only if they had been coughing for at least 1-3 weeks. Therefore, there is no evidence regarding the impact of pertussis vaccines on human colonization and infection.
