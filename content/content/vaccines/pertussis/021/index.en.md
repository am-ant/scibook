As cocooning is not very effective, the CDC has recommended since 2011 that all pregnant women be vaccinated against pertussis during the third trimester. This is so that the antibodies against pertussis can be passed on to the foetus through the placenta. The CDC does not mention the fact that aluminium also passes through the placenta. Many women complain that they started contractions right after vaccination, and that the vaccination led to premature birth, but according to studies, they just think that the vaccination accelerated the birth. This happened completely by accident, and with no relation to the vaccine.
Number of pertussis cases since 2011 only [increased](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/incidences?c=USA).
Cocooning has not been abolished, and is still commonly used as a preventative technique along with vaccination of pregnant women.
In contrast, cocooning in Australia was also implemented, but as it was found to be ineffective, and they later [abolished it](http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/states-ending-free-parent-whooping-vaccine/news-story/03235c4dc2b3fe6456b7e6c3aeae1d83).
While the CDC [established](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6041a4.htm) that it is effective and perfectly safe to vaccinate pregnant women against whooping cough during pregnancy (based on two studies analyzing [52](http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(10)02286-6/abstract) and [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875487) pregnant women), no one has checked how this vaccine affects the foetus. Furthermore, it is not at all clear why the CDC recommends vaccination in only the third trimester. According to some studies, vaccination in the second trimester is much more [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4787611). In Switzerland, for example, women [are recommended](http://ge.ch/sante/media/site_sante/files/imce/epidemiologie-maladies-transmissibles/doc/recommand_coquluche_bull_ofsp_2013.pdf) to get vaccinated in the second trimester (starting from the 13th week of pregnancy).
