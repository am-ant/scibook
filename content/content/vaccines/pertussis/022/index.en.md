We try not to delve too deeply into biology, but in order to realize the absurdity of vaccination against whooping cough, we need to understand a little how the immune system works. Let´s consider leprosy, a disease for which there is no vaccine. Leprosy, roughly speaking, can be of two kinds - tuberculoid or lepromatous. Tuberculoid leprosy is a relatively mild form of the disease in which only the skin is affected, and can often pass without treatment. Lepromatous leprosy, on the other hand, is more severe. In the kind of the disease, all mucous membranes become affected, and the outcome is often lethal. Intermediate forms between these two kinds of the disease are also possible.
What determines whether a person will develop tuberculoid leprosy or lepromatous leprosy? The answer to this question is straight forward: the reaction of the individual´s immune system in response to the bacterium.
The immune system is divided into two subsystems: cellular immunity and humoral immunity.
**Humoral immunity** is the immunity mediated by antibodies and other molecules. In response to antigens, B cells produce antibodies that are able to cling to pathogens and either neutralize them or signal to other cells to destroy them. **Th2** cells are responsible for this system.
**Cellular immunity** is an immune response mediated by cells such as phagocytes, CD8 T-cells and others. These cells recognize infected cells and either devour them or kill them. In this system, **Th1** cells are responsible.
These systems suppress one another by producing signalling molecules called cytokines. In other words, the cytokines secreted by Th1 cells suppress Th2 cells, and vice versa.
In the case of leprosy, if the immune response shifts towards cellular immunity then the disease is more easily controlled, but if the immune response shifts towards humoral immunity, then the disease can take a heavy turn. In this case, cellular immunity (Th1) is therefore much more effective than humoral immunity (Th2) at controlling the disease. Humoral immunity actually interferes with the ability of cellular immunity to perform its task.
