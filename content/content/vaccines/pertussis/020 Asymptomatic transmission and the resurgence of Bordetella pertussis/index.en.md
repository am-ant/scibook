In the last 20 years, the incidence of whooping cough in many countries has increased significantly. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon: 1) a weakening protective immunity from vaccination, 2) evolution of pertussis, and/or 3) low vaccination coverage. More recent studies have also suggested a fourth possible explanation: the asymptomatic infection of vaccinated individuals.
The authors of this study analysed the incidence of whooping cough in the US and the UK, conducted a genetic analysis of the bacterial strains, and concluded that the asymptomatic infection of vaccinated individuals is the most logical explanation. According to their model, increasing the coverage via the acellular vaccination increases the incidence of the asymptomatic disease by a factor of 30, and the incidence of the symptomatic disease by a factor of 5-15. This is consistent with the observed data. The authors therefore propose to vaccinate pregnant women or return to the whole-cell vaccine until new vaccines are developed.
