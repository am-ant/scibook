Pertussis is only dangerous for infants, but since vaccination does not work for infants, both adults and children are vaccinated against whooping cough with one goal - to create a herd immunity that will protect infants. However, vaccination achieves the opposite goal. First, instead of contracting pertussis once, and forgetting about it for the rest of your life, vaccinated children and adults can become sick with pertussis many times over. Moreover, since the disease often asymptomatic, they become a "quiet reservoir" of infection, spreading the disease to their families, and to infants. And the more vaccine doses they receive, the more they are susceptible to infection. Instead of alienating a brother who has fallen ill with whooping cough from an infant, it is difficult to diagnose a brother because of an atypical course of the disease, because of the changed definition of the disease, and simply because many doctors are unwilling to diagnose whooping cough in vaccinated patients.
-DTP is the most reactogenic of all existing vaccines.
- DTaP contains aluminum, and DPT also ethyl mercury.
- The risk of dying after vaccination, even with the DTaP, is much greater than the risk of dying from pertussis itself.
- In recent years, the number of cases of whooping cough has been steadily increasing. This is not because of the appearance of antivaxxers, but rather because more people are being vaccinated against pertussis. We vaccinate pregnant women, parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts, and even introduce extra booster vaccinations for children into the existing vaccination schedule. The more doses an individual receives of this vaccine, the further their immunity shifts towards Th2, and the more they become susceptible to the disease.
