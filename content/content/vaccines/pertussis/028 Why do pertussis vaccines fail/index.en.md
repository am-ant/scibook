Sometimes, B. parapertussis (para-whooping cough) can occupy the place of the ordinary pertussis bacterium. Vaccination does not protect against B. parapertussis and, in fact, it is already responsible for 16% of all cases of the disease.
According to another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1719607/), parapertussis is actually responsible for 36% of whooping cough cases. In this study, while 62% of individuals with whooping cough had been vaccinated, 81% of those with para-whooping cough had been vaccinated.
According to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2880100/) in mice, vaccination against pertussis increases the risk of contracting para-whooping cough by 40 times (compared to unvaccinated individuals).
Here is an example ([here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5440125/)) of para-whooping cough outbreak in Minnesota: 100% of cases had been vaccinated.
