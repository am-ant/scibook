Let's now return to whooping cough.
- While the acellular pertussis vaccine shifts the immune response towards humoral immunity (Th2), the whole-cell vaccine is more associated with cellular immunity (Th1; the whole-cell vaccine also shifts the immune response towards Th2, but to a lesser extent).
- Even though the acellular vaccine contains far fewer antigens than the whole-cell vaccine, it contributes to the production of a greater amount of antibodies.
- Thus, the greater the number of doses of the acellular vaccine, the shorter the immunity from these vaccinations lasts. This is because additional doses shift the immune response further and further towards the humoral immunity (more antibodies are produced), making the immune response less and less effective. In other words, the more doses a person receives, the more likely he will get sick, and the longer he will be contagious.
