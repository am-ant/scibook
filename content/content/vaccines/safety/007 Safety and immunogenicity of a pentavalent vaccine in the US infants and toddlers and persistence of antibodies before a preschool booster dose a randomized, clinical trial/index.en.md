This is an article that reports the results of the aforementioned study:
Safety was tested for 30 and 60 days after each dose.
In 5.2% children from the test group and also in 5.2% from the control group (which received 3 different inoculations) serious adverse effects were noticed. Scientists decided that these adverse effects were not related to the inoculation. Authors did not report what adverse effects there were and why they were excluded.
