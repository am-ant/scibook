This is, more or less, how majority of safety trials look. They are rarely last longer than few days or weeks. Most of the time they have serious adverse events occurring in absolutely healthy children during this short period of time, and they are rarely happen to be related to vaccination. They are not related because in the control group, which receives a different vaccine or the same vaccines without an antigen, same events are registered. In these short clinical trials it is impossible to find autoimmune, oncological or neurological diseases, as well as many other diseases, which are not rare results of vaccination (it will be proven later), but that are not possible to be diagnosed earlier than few months or few years after vaccination.
Moreover, vaccine inserts always state that there no trials of carcinogenicity of the medicine, mutagenecity and its possible effect on reproductive system were conducted.
