Here is an [example](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00662870) of clinical trials of Daptacel vaccine. To take part in the trial a child should be absolutely healthy, born after the 37th week, not sensitive to any of the vaccine components, without developmental delays, the family should not have a history of immune diseases, and so on. More or less the same requirements are stated for all other vaccine trials. That is, in comparison to medicines, which are usually tested on ill patients and are then given to ill patient, vaccines are tested exclusively on healthy children and are then given to both, healthy and not so healthy children, and even very sick children.
