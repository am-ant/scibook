Fourthly, research is usually done on relatively small groups of children. For example, Hepatitis B vaccine [was tested](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/biologicsbloodvaccines/vaccines/approvedproducts/ucm110114.pdf) on 147 newborns. Usually, vaccines are tested on children from third world countries, which halves the costs for clinical trials. Often, children and parents in the third world countries [do not know](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2893485/Children-guinea-pigs-anti-cervical-cancer-drug.html) that they are receiving an experimental vaccine.
