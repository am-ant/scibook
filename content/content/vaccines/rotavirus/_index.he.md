epigraph:
  text: "Vaccination is a barbarous practice, and it is one of the most fatal of all the delusions current in our time, not to be found even among the so-called savage races of the world. Conscientious objectors to vaccination should stand alone, if need be, against the whole world, in defence of their conviction."
