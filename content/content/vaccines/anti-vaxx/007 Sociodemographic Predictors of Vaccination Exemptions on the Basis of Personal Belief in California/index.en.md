The number of non-medically refused vaccinations in California increased 4-fold between 2001 and 2014 (from 0.77% to 3.15%).
In private schools, there were twice as many refusals as in public schools. The percentage of refusers was higher among white, richer and more educated people.
In other states the same is [observed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795202) - the percentage of those who refuse vaccinations in private schools is much higher than in public.
