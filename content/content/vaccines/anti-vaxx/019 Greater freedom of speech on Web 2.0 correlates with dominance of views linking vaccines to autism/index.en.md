The authors of this study analyzed YouTube, Google, Wikipedia and Pubmed, and came to the conclusion that the more freedom of speech on a resource, the more it associates vaccines with autism. Freedom of speech on YouTube is highest, in Google it is less, and in Wikipedia and Pubmed it is very low. This leads to the fact that on YouTube 75% of the videos link vaccinations with autism, in Google 41% of the links, in Wikipedia 14% of the articles, and in Pubmed 17% of the articles link the vaccines with autism (more than in Wikipedia!).
But the worst thing is, the authors note that anti-vaccine activists use scientific arguments (!), Doctors (!), Famous people and personal stories to inspire confidence! The problem is, they write, that YouTube, unlike Google, does not give priority to scientific authorities in search ads.
Doctors participated in 36% of the anti-vaccine ads, and only 28% of the pro-vaccination ads.
The authors of the study propose to moderate the Internet, and also urge medical institutions to be more active there.
