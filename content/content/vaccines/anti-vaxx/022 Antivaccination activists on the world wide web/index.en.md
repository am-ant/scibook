In 43% of queries about vaccinations, search engines showed anti-vaccination sites in the top ten. In Google, 100% of the sites in the top ten were anti-vaccine. More than half of the sites cite doctors who speak out against vaccination. 75% cite "scientific" sources.
The authors conclude that there is a high probability that parents stumble on anti-vaccination materials on the Internet.
