In 17 years from 1969 to 1985 in Finland, 106 cases of tetanus have been recorded. Five of them were children under 18 years of age. Four children have been fully vaccinated. Whether the fifth child has been vaccinated is unknown.
The last case of neonatal tetanus in Finland was recorded in 1915, and vaccination started in 1957.
