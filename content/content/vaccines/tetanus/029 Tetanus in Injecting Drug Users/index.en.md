Cases of tetanus in drug users were already described in Victorian era. They injected morphine under the skin then.
In Chicago, in the â€˜50s, before the vaccination began, most patients were heroin addicts. Out of the 22 cases of tetanus, 12 were drug users, and they all died. Only four of the rest died. CDC [reports](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00051456.htm) that 55% of tetanus cases in California were intravenous drug users.
It is reported [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17261932) that five out of five tetanus patients in three years in Saudi Arabia, were heroin addicts.
