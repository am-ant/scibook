Hyper-immunization of mice against tetanus causes [antiphospholipid syndrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphospholipid_syndrome). This is also a result of molecular mimicry.
It seems that in humans, tetanus, hepatitis B and influenza vaccines also cause this disease.[[1]](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0961203312438115), [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22617823)
It is reported [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27435706) that the tetanus vaccine can lead to autoimmune diseases.
