If tetanus toxin is treated with formalin, then it gets converted to toxoid, which is no longer toxic. It is used as a vaccine.
In case of injury the vaccine is useless, since the production of antibodies is a process, which [takes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1574917) from several days to several weeks. In this case, [immunoglobulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tetanus_immunoglobulin) (i.e. the antibodies themselves) injections are given.
Immunoglobulin (TIG) is isolated from the blood of repeatedly vaccinated horses or people. Upon visiting a doctor with an injury they will usually try to give the patient a tetanus vaccine. The vaccine, however, is useless after getting infected, and the immunoglobulin is only given in case of a very serious injury.
