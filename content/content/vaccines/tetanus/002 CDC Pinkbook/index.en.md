Tetanus is caused by the Clostridium tetani bacteria. The spores of this bacteria are everywhere. They are in soil, in animal intestines (especially herbivores), in human intestines, in dust, on clothing, on the body and even in saliva.
This bacteria does not multiply in an aerobic environment. Once it gets into anaerobic environment, however, it comes to life and begins to release a very strong toxin (tetanospasmin). If, due to injury, this toxin enters the nervous system, it causes muscle spasms and can lead to paralysis. In developed countries, about 11% of the disease cases are fatal. Not all strains of the bacteria release the toxin.
