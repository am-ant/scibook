The ‘protective’ level of antibodies (0.01 IU/ml) was [determined](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/25/3/464/97275/TETANUS-IMMUNITY-THE-RESISTANCE-OF-GUINEA-PIGS-TO) in 1937 on the basis of experiments on guinea pigs, and was extrapolated to humans. In recent years, in some countries, the protective has already been considered as 0.1 IU/ml, and sometimes even 0.15 IU/ml.
