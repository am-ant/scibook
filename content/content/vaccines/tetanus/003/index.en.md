Tetanus vaccine is almost always combined with diphtheria and whooping cough vaccine (DTaP/DTP), but it is also usually combined with poliomyelitis, Hib and sometimes with hepatitis B.
In fact, [there is](http://www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/PQ_105_tet_10_dose_sanofi_pasteur/en/) a monovalent vaccine against tetanus, but it contains ethylmercury, which is why it is only intended for the third world countries.
There is a vaccine against tetanus and diphtheria, but without whooping cough (DT for children and Td for adults).
There is a tetanus vaccine with diphtheria, but without pertussis (DT for children and Td for adults).
Theoretically, tetanus vaccine without aluminum does [exist](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/520684). In practice, of course, it's not manufactured.
