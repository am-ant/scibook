- WHO has been working on development of pregnancy vaccine since 1970s.
- WHO has been working on the issue of reducing birth rates in third world countries since 1945.
- The US government has been officially [supporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Study_Memorandum_200) the decline in birth rates in third world countries since 1970s.
- The vaccination protocol used in Kenya (5 doses every six months) completely coincided with the pregnancy vaccination protocol, and did not coincide with the tetanus vaccination protocol.
- Vaccines in Kenya were guarded by the police. Each vial had to be returned to WHO under the police supervision. All vaccines were kept in a hotel in Nairobi, and distributed only from there.
- Half of the vials provided by WHO for testing contained hCG.
- Women vaccinated against tetanus in the Philippines had hCG antibodies.
The authors believe that WHO is responsible for depopulation in Kenya.
