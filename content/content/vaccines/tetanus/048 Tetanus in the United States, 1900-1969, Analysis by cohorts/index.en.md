As in the case with whooping cough, it is [argued](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18000199) that the vaccine is responsible for reducing the incidence of tetanus by 92%, and the mortality rate by 99%.
This article analyzes cases of tetanus in USA since 1900 and shows a graph, according to which, the mortality rate decreased by more than 95% even before the vaccination began in the late 40s.
