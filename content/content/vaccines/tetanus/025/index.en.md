From 1987 to 2008, 13% of tetanus cases and 29% of tetanus deaths [occurred](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt16-tetanus.html) in people sick with diabetes. Diabetics suffer from tetanus three times more often than the rest, and die four times more often. 15% of tetanus cases [occur](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5203a1.htm) in intravenous drug users.
Even if one were to assume that tetanus antibodies effectively neutralize the toxin, they would still need to get to the place of injury. And if the injury were to occur in a place with no sufficient blood supply, antibodies would not be able to get there. This is why diabetics suffer from tetanus much more often.
