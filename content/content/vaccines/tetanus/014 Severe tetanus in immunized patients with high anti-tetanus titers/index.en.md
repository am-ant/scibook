Three people got sick with tetanus, one of them died. All three of them were not only fully vaccinated, but also had very high levels of antibodies. One of them had the antibodies level 2500 times higher than the protective level (0.01 IU/ml). This patient was hyper-immunized for creating commercial immunoglobulin. That is, he was given many vaccines in order to create high level of antibodies, which would then be isolated from his blood and sold as immunoglobulin.
The other patient had 0.2 in vitro level of antibodies, but when he was tested in vivo on mice, it turned out to be less than 0.01 IU/ml. The authors conclude that having immunity to toxoid is not at all equal to having immunity to toxin.
