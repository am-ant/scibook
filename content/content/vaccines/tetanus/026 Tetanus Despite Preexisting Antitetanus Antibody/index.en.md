Since 1955, 90% of tetanus cases in New York [were](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/574158) heroin addicts. Same in [Chicago](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/88/2/215/169597/INVESTIGATIONS-IN-TETANUS-IN-NARCOTICS-ADDICTS-IN).
A case of brother and sister who got tetanus from heroin is described here. The brother had a severe form of tetanus and the sister had a mild one. They both recovered â€“ the brother in three weeks and the sister in two weeks. Since the sister received the vaccine 15 years ago, the authors concluded that was the reason she got the mild form. They also concluded that the brother was most likely never vaccinated, and that is why he got severe tetanus, although his antibodies level was never tested, and if he was ever vaccinated remained unclear.
