Tetanus is an extremely rare disease, which is quite difficult to contract. It was extremely rare even during the First World War, with all its countless wounds and lack of sanitation. Each year, 50 people in USA [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_strike) of a lightning strike. Each year, 30 people get tetanus, three of them die on average, and most of them are intravenous drug users, diabetics and the elderly. In developed countries, children do not die from tetanus, and barely ever get sick with it. It is far more logical to be afraid of gas gangrene, which is contracted in the same way as tetanus, but causes death 100 more often, or lightning, which cause death 15 times more often.
