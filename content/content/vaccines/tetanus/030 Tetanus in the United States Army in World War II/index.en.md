Randomized controlled study of the tetanus vaccine effectiveness was never conducted. Then how was it determined that the vaccine is effective?
During the First World War, 70 cases of tetanus were observed among the American soldiers (13.4 per 100,000 injuries). During the Second World War, when all soldiers got vaccinated, 12 cases of tetanus were observed (0.44 per 100,000 injuries).
In addition, 80 cases of tetanus were observed in German soldiers, who did not get vaccinated. However, among the Luftwaffe (Air Force) soldiers, who got vaccinated, no cases of tetanus were reported.
On the basis of this information, it was concluded that the vaccine is very effective, and starting in 1947 it was given to civilian population.
The fact that the WWI was fought mainly on horses, while the WWII was fought on tanks, did not seem to bother the researchers. Neither were they bothered by the fact, that Luftwaffe fought in the air, while the tetanus bacteria lives mainly in the soil.
However, the gas gangrene [took lives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3716723) of 100,000 German soldiers (10-12% of all wounded) during the WWI. During the WWII, 0.3-1.5% died of it, and during the Vietnam War â€“ only 0.016% died. From 1950s to 1980s the mortality rate of gas gangrene decreased from 70% to 41%. And all this without any vaccinations.
