One of the ways of infection with tetanus was smallpox vaccination. [[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02795578), [[2]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4578620). Also, tetanus was caused by circumcision, medical bandages, sanitary pads, abortion and removal of the uterus. A case of tetanus infection due to rapture of the foreskin during intercourse was reported, which means that tetanus bacteria probably also live in vagina.
The authors analyzed 14 types of sanitary pads and found tetanus spores and C. welchii spores (more about them later) on all of them. Some of the pads were claimed to be sterile by the manufacturer.
Tetanus bacteria were also found on sterile sets of hygienic bandages and pads intended for childbirth.
The authors conclude that such non-sterile pads should not be used after childbirth and uterus removal, since 3.5% of cases of tetanus are postpartum tetanus.
They also say that the state regulates a can of sardines more than the pads that are used during childbirth, and that aborigines, who do not use pads, are safer than their civilized sisters.
