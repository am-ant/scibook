It is believed that there is no possibility of natural immunity against tetanus, and that even previous illness does not provide immunity from future infections. Vaccination is considered to be the only means of protection against tetanus.
In developed countries, 70% of tetanus cases and 80% of deaths are among people over the age of 50.
Mortality from tetanus in people under 30 years of age is almost zero, whereas among the elderly, the mortality rate is 52%.
