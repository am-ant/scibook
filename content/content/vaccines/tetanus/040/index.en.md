According to VAERS, 24 deaths and 176 cases of disability were [recorded](http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&VAX=DT&VAX=TD&VAX=TTOX&VAX_YEAR_LOW=2001&VAX_YEAR_HIGH=2008) in the period from 2001 to 2008 in the USA after tetanus vaccination (without the whooping cough component). (These numbers should be multiplied by 10 at the least, and it should be remembered that these vaccines are quite rare, and most children get a combination vaccine with whopping cough).
During these 8 years only 233 cases and 26 deaths from tetanus have been [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt16-tetanus.html).
Among those cases, 27% were vaccinated more than 4 times and 40% were not vaccinated. 15% were intravenous drug users, 15% were diabetes patients, and 49% [were](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/tetanus.html) over 50 years old.
Not a single tetanus case in children under the age of 5 was reported. No one under the age of 30 died from tetanus. It is reported [here](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/109/1/e2) that from 1992 to 2000, 15 cases of tetanus in children under the age of 15 were recorded. No one died, although most of them were unvaccinated.
