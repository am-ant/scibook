Since tetanus vaccines [are given](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6071998) at every opportunity, it leads to hyper-immunization (the level of antibodies above 5IU/ml). In Italy, among those born before 1968, 11% [were](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3499712) hyper-immunized. Among those born after 1968, there [were](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8491525) already 17%.
In 53% of adults in Finland (over 50 years of age) the level of antibodies [was](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19596410) above 1IU/ml. The number of side effects from the vaccine has doubled in a decade. The authors recommend getting booster vaccines once every 20 years, not 10.
