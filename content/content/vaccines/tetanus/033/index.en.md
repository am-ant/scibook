In 2014, WHO and UNICEF held a vaccination campaign for women of childbearing age (14-19 y.o.) in Kenya. Women received five doses of the vaccine. The Church usually carries out vaccination in Kenya, but this time the WHO carried out the vaccinations itself. The Organization of Catholic Bishops in Kenya found it strange and decided to send that vaccine for testing into four different labs. According to the Bishopsâ€™ statement, all labs [found](http://www.kccb.or.ke/home/news-2/press-statement-by-the-kenya-conference-of-catholic-bishops/) hCG in the tested vials.
WHO and UNICEF [explained](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/11/14/the-tense-standoff-between-catholic-bishops-and-the-kenyan-government-over-tetanus-vaccines) the vaccination of women of childbearing age by the fact that the vaccines were intended to prevent neonatal tetanus. However, according to the WHO statistics, in five years prior to this campaign, only 19 cases of neonatal tetanus have been [recorded](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/incidences?c=KEN) in Kenya (population of Kenya is 46 million people). The need for five doses of the vaccine (instead of the regular one or two) was never explained.
One of the labs [stated](http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Church-misinterpreted-test-results/-/1056/2523968/-/smap3pz/-/index.html), that they had no knowledge that what they were testing was a vaccine. Had they known, they certainly would not have found hCG there.
