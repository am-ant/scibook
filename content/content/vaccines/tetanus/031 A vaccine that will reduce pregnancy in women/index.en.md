hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) is a hormone, which is released during pregnancy, and which the home pregnancy test is based on.
Since this hormone is absolutely necessary for the development of pregnancy, scientists came up with a brilliant idea. They thought that if they could trigger an autoimmune reaction to this hormone, the immune system would begin to see it as a pathogen and destroy it. And that would make a vaccine against pregnancy.
How to trigger an immune response to a hormone? Simply by adding aluminum and tetanus toxoid to it. The immune system will now produce antibodies to hCG, in addition to the tetanus antibodies. Said and done. They started with this back in the ‘70s, but it did not [work](http://www.pnas.org/content/73/1/218.full.pdf). And in the early ‘90s, another adjuvant was added to the vaccine – sheep [lutropin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone) (the hormone responsible for the ovulation) and diphtheria toxoid, and the vaccine started to work! Of course, the level of antibodies was constantly decreasing, so the vaccine had to be injected once every few months, but the Hindu women, on whom the vaccine was tested, almost never got pregnant. Although, some researchers [accuse](http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v275/n1/pdf/scientificamerican0796-38.pdf) the author of this experiment of skipping the preliminary animal testing, and doing the testing on women right away. And Maneka Gandhi, the former Minister of the Environment of India, claims that his contraceptive vaccine for male dogs killed too many of them.
Similar vaccines were also being [developed](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/61301/1/WHO_HRP_WHO_93.1.pdf) under the guidance of WHO by other research groups (page 18).
