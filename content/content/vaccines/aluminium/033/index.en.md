The topic of antiperspirants (deodorants containing aluminum) is quite controversial, as is any other topic where a lot of money is involved. There is still no clear evidence that antiperspirants cause breast cancer. However, here is an example of an article that every woman should read and then decide for herself whether there is enough reason to assume that the connection between antiperspirants and breast cancer is highly probable, and if she should take part in this experiment, or perhaps, it would be better not to risk it.
My wife was very reluctant to give up her antiperspirant, claiming that deodorants without aluminum were less effective, but I still managed to find her a good deodorant without aluminum, which she is happy with.
