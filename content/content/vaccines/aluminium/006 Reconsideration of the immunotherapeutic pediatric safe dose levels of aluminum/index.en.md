The amount of aluminum in vaccines is based on effectiveness, ignoring body weight when determining the safe level.
Conclusion on the safety of the amount of aluminum in vaccines was based solely on the studies of oral consumption effects on adult mice and rats.
On their first day of life babies receive 17 times more aluminum than the set maximum level would be if the dosage were adjusted for body weight.
