Despite the fact that aluminum adjuvants have been used in vaccines for 90 years, it is still unknown why and how exactly aluminum causes such a strong immune response.
High toxicity and danger of aluminum consumed orally has been known since 1911 – when Dr William Gies published the results of seven years of research on aluminum in baking powder, preservatives and food coloring. Aluminum affects memory, concentration and behavior. (Aluminum is still used in baking powder and food preservatives).
Premature babies that were given formula containing aluminum developed worse than babies given formula without aluminum.
Aluminum that is used in kidney dialysis leads to dementia, seizures, psychosis, etc.
Aluminum is also associated with the Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, ASD and epilepsy.
The amount of aluminum in vaccines is dozens of times higher than the standards set by the FDA.
The article is worth reading in full.
