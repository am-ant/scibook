The more vaccinations containing aluminum are given in the country, the more children with ASD there are.
The increase in the number of children with ASD in the US correlates with the increase in the number of aluminum adjuvants used. (r = 0.92, p<0.0001)
The authors use [Hillâ€™s criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria) and conclude that the relationship between aluminum in vaccines and ASD is probably causal. This article is also worth reading in full.
