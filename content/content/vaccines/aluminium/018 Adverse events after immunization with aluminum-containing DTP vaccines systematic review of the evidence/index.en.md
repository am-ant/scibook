And here is a systematic review and meta-analysis, which proves that aluminum in DTP vaccines is safe. I highly recommend reading this articles in full. After doing so, you opinion of science will never be the same again.
The authors identified 8 studies of aluminum adjuvants and did a meta-analysis of 5 of them.
The safety studies lasted from 24 hours to 6 weeks. The only side effects these studies were looking for were crying, screaming, pain, fever, seizure and redness.
The authors have concluded that although these studies were of very poor quality, there is no substitute for aluminum in vaccines. And even if the alternative were found, all the vaccines would need to be tested and patented again, which would put the vaccination programs worldwide in question.
Then comes the final, shocking conclusion: “Despite the lack of qualitative evidence, we do not recommend conducting any further research on this topic.”
This was the systematic review of all the current literature on the safety of aluminum in vaccines.
No, not exactly. It was not just an ordinary systematic review. It was a systematic review by [Cochrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_(organisation)), the most respected medical science organization whose systematic reviews are recognized as being of the highest quality in the world. One could only imagine what the ordinary, lower quality systematic reviews look like.
