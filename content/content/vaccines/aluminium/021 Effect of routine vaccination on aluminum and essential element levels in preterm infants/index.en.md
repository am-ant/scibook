A very interesting review article, which analyzes all the published studies of safety of aluminum adjuvants.
- Aluminum stimulates a humoral immune response and barely stimulates the cellular one;
- The FDA approved amount of aluminum per vaccine dose (0.85 mg) was determined empirically based on the effectiveness of this dose;
- Aforementioned study on rabbits is currently the only existing pharmacokinetic study on aluminum adjuvants on animals. Moreover, the adjuvants tested in this study differ from the adjuvants actually used in the vaccines;
- FDA’s conclusion that aluminum in vaccines is safe is based on two theoretical articles, which are analyzed in detail here. The ‘safe dose’ of aluminum for babies was extrapolated from the studies on mice that received aluminum orally. The authors conclude that comparing the toxicity of aluminum ions absorbed orally with the toxicity of aluminum salts administered intramuscularly is nonsense.
