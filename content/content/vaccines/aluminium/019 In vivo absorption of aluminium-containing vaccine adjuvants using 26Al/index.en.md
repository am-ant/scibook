Although the aluminum adjuvants have been used since 1926, what exactly happens to them after they are injected into a muscle is unknown to science.
The researches took several rabbits and injected two of them with radioactive aluminum hydroxide, and the other two with aluminum phosphate. 28 days later the rabbits were killed and at that moment 94% of aluminum hydroxide and 78% of aluminum phosphate still remained in the rabbits’ bodies.
The authors examined several internal organs and concluded that little aluminum accumulated in each of them. However, it is unclear how exactly they determined that there was only ‘little’ aluminum, since there was no control group of rabbits that were not injected with any kind of vaccine in the experiment. The authors have not examined the rabbits’ bones (because they damaged them), even though it is a known fact that aluminum accumulates in the bones. Neither did they examine the muscles that were injected with aluminum.
The study only lasted 28 days, although it is known that aluminum stays in the body for years.
The authors concluded that the body successfully disposes of aluminum, regardless of the fact that most of the aluminum remained in the body, and it is completely unclear in which organs particularly.
