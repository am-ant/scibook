Very interesting TED-x [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvh3JhsrQ0w) about how a neonatologist cured her husband from Alzheimer's disease using coconut oil. A preliminary study [confirmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26667739) the therapeutic effect of coconut oil against Alzheimer's disease.
