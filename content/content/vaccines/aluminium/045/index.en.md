[Vaccine syndrome](https://vimeo.com/215109690)
This film is also part of the series Vaccines revealed.
250,000 soldiers participating in the Gulf War suffer from the Gulf War syndrome (Gulf War Syndrome), representing 35% of all soldiers participating in it, and suffering from soldiers who did not take part in the fighting, and more than a million American soldiers suffer from the Gulf War syndrome .The reason for this appears to be an experimental vaccine from anthrax (anthrax), as well as other vaccines that US soldiers are required to do in large kits The American soldier who refused to be vaccinated goes to court, then goes to jail for a couple of months, gets a big fine, and then he is fired, depriving him of titles and pensions (dishonorable discharge).
35,000 soldiers died of the side effects of vaccination Anthrax: By comparison, less than 6,800 soldiers were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan (it's unclear where they got that number from). - And where do the Iraqis have the anthrax, which the Americans were so afraid of? His Saddam Hussein was given President Jimmy Carter to help him in his war with Iran.
Soldiers vaccinated from anthrax gave birth to children with severe birth defects.
22 veterans commit suicide every day. (I often heard this fact, but did not imagine that it could be somehow related to vaccinations.)
And remember the envelopes with anthrax, which a week after 9/11 were sent to senators and news agencies, resulting in 5 people were killed, and then Iraq and Al Qaeda were accused? The FBI [believes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks) that they were sent by a scientist who worked in the US Army over an anthrax vaccine.
