There is a lot of aluminum in toothpastes, as well as in tea.
Toothpaste with aluminum [aggravates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8462312) dermatitis (which was caused by vaccination).
Toothpaste with aluminum [causes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9118189) dental caries.
Aluminum in toothpaste [plays](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2256453) an even bigger role in the occurrence of Alzheimerâ€™s than the aluminum in water. 60% of all the toothpaste on the market contains aluminum.
