The second, and probably even more important reason for using adjuvants is purely economic.
Growing viruses is difficult, time consuming and expensive. Perhaps, if significant amount of virus were injected, the immune system would respond to it appropriately and produce antibodies. It would, however, be a much more expensive vaccine. It is much cheaper to take a small amount of the virus, add some adjuvant and get a strong immune reaction. When getting an FDA approval, vaccine’s effectiveness is much more important than its safety. Safety, as we’ve seen, is fairly easy to fake. Faking effectiveness is much harder.
