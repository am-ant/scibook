Sheep were divided into three groups. The first group received 19 vaccines with aluminum in the course of 15 months. The other group received injections of aluminum adjuvant only. The third one was the control group and received saline solution. 100% of the vaccinated and 92% of those injected with adjuvant had granulomas develop at the injection sites; the vaccinated ones had significantly more granulomas. The aluminum particles in granulomas of those vaccinated were much longer than of those injected with adjuvant. The fact that in the presence of an antigen the aluminum particles might increase in size is known from other studies.
The concentration of aluminum in lymph nodes of the vaccinated ones was 32 times higher than of those who only received an adjuvant, and 86 times higher than of the control group.
The authors conclude that aluminum gets to the lymph nodes through macrophages. Degenerative changes were observed in macrophages of both groups.
Vaccinated sheep [demonstrated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395948) asocial, repetitive and aggressive behavior, and bit the wool of other, peacefully grazing sheep. The levels of cortisol were elevated in both vaccinated sheep and sheep that received the adjuvant. The behavioral changes were more pronounced in the vaccinated group that in the group that only received the adjuvant.
The authors conducted this study, because the sheep often had autoimmune diseases in response to vaccination.
