0.83% of children vaccinated with Infanrix had aluminum granulomas form at the injection site. 85% of them became allergic to aluminum. Two vaccines with aluminum doubled the risk of granuloma.
57% of the children had itchy granulomas form 2 weeks to 13 month after the vaccination; they disappeared after 22 month on average.
0.98% of vaccinated children had granulomas form, and 95% of them became allergies to aluminum â€“ another study shows.
MMR vaccine, which does not contain aluminum, can become a trigger for the formation of granulomas. More: [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736873)
