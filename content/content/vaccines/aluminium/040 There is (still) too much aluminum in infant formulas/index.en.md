There is a lot of aluminum in baby formula. According to EPA standard, drinking water may contain up to a maximum of [200 µg](https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/secondary-drinking-water-standards-guidance-nuisance-chemicals) of aluminum per liter. 15 of the tested baby formulas have from 176 µg to 700 µg of aluminum per liter.
Three years later the authors [analyzed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3851493) 30 more types of baby formula, with similar results.
