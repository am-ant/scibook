If everything were that simple, then the vaccine would provide a lifelong immunity, which is what happens after getting the actual disease. However, this is not what happens. Immunity obtained from a vaccine usually lasts 3-5 years. The most effective vaccines give immunity for 10-20 year. (What exactly is meant by the word ‘immunity’ in the context of vaccination is a separate topic, which will be discussed in another section).
Our immune system is not stupid. It understands that the fragment of a killed virus or bacterium does not pose any real danger and thus [produces](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3117407) antibodies against it very poorly.
How do the smart scientists solve this problem? They add an adjuvant to the vaccine. **An adjuvant** is a molecule, which the immune system recognizes as a very toxic one and reacts strongly to. In addition, the immune system reacts to the virus as well and, to make things worse, it also reacts to all the other vaccine ingredients, and not just to them. This, in turn, leads to allergies and various autoimmune diseases. This is why immunologists call aluminum the ‘immunologist’s dirty little secret.’
There are vaccine ingredients such as egg whites (ovalbumin), for example. When the immune system learns to recognize the virus as a threat, it could easily consider ovalbumin to be dangerous as well, which could [lead](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM195204032461403) to egg allergies.
[Peanut oil in vaccines](http://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/19/peanut-oil-used-in-a-new-vaccine.html) might have caused the widespread allergy to peanuts.
Squalene, the other vaccine adjuvant, is also produced in human tissue, and the immune response to it is probably what [causes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12127050) autoimmune diseases.
