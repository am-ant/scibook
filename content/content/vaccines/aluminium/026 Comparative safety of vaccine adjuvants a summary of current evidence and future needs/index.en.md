Aluminum salts induce cell death and inflammation, which could explain why granulomas might form at the injection site.
Aluminum adjuvants induce a shift in the immune response towards Th2 and the production of IgE, which increases the risk of developing allergies and anaphylactic reactions.
In cats, dogs and ferrets, aluminum adjuvants cause granulomas that can progress into malignant fibrosarcomas. It is unknown why such tumors do not develop in humans.
It is also unknown how cumulative doses of aluminum adjuvants contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s or chronic bone disease.
Aluminum and squalene adjuvants cause serious side effects in animals. Even though its relevance to humans in unknown, this data is still ignored when determining the adjuvant safety for new vaccines. For example, it has been known for many years now that squalene can lead to autoimmune diseases in susceptible animals. Consequently, the consumer may reasonably ask if this data indicates the possibility of developing autoimmune diseases in susceptible humans. There is currently no good answer to this question.
The author concludes that we know very little about the toxicity of adjuvants.
